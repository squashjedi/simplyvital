Treatment of an episode of depression must continue after apparent response in order to consolidate response and prevent relapse. A continuation treatment period of at least four months after response of the acute episode is required in all patients with depression. Most depression is recurrent, and prophylactic treatment with antidepressants reduces the risk of new episodes. This treatment needs to be continued over very long periods, because the risk of new episodes does not appear to diminish with time.In selecting an antidepressant for long-term treatment efficacy, safety and tolerability in the long term should be taken into account since not all antidepressants have been adequately tested, and some do not appear to be effective. The most thoroughly tested antidepressants are the tricyclic imipramine and the new selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.                                 jillcatrina',0,'0','','',0,0),(15,986,'Hiroshi','bill@billdick.co.uk','','83.140.154.254','2012-08-03 13:29:22','2012-08-03 12:29:22','I wish to express my thkans to the writer for bailing me out of this particular predicament.

Without detracting from the efforts and support we put into all the other WordCamps, in which we are eager to take part every time, Catania meant something more to us, as it’s part of our hearts, our roots. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It was 2010, so 9 years ago, when the first bit of today’s YITH took part in their first WordCamp, and it was right in Catania.

So, coming back for a WordCamp in Catania after 9 years meant a lot to all of us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is also one of the reasons why the YITH team took part in the event as a whole, it was the massive green spot standing out from the crowd. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1084126\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"520\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01.jpg 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01-300x156.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01-768x399.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01-261x136.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01-311x162.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01-363x189.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/01-270x140.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></span></i></p>\n<blockquote><p><em>Alessio: I have attended many WordCamps so far, both in Italy and abroad, but this one had a totally different flavour. The event took place in Catania, the town where I live and work, and it was so nice to share it with all the YITH team.</em><br />\n<em>It&#8217;s been years since a WordCamp last took place in Catania, but after seeing the enthusiasm of all the attendees, amazed by the attention to every detail, I would not be surprised to see it happen again in 2020 and even more successful.</em></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The only sad thing was that not just everyone could be there, because of several reasons. We missed them a lot and we want to send a huge virtual hug to Alessandra, Sara and Ronald who were there with us in spirit. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enough with pathetic reflections, let&#8217;s go to the point: the event turned out to be a great success! </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday &#8211; The Contributor Day</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Friday was a busy day, start at 9 am, the location got quickly crowded. The working teams were organized by subject with tables for Core, Polyglots, Community, Themes and Support. As soon as the day started, participants took a seat at their favourite table and began focussing on their work with admirable commitment. It was so rewarding to see everyone work hard on their projects after being introduced to the relevant contribution group.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Also, a surprising fact was that not only did the Contributor day record a high percentage of participants but also many of them had never attended a WordCamp before. This proves that the local community is active and there&#8217;s room for growth.</span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1084127\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02.jpg 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02-300x123.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02-768x315.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02-261x107.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02-311x128.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02-363x149.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/02-270x111.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a></span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the evening, it was nice to meet the organisers, speakers, volunteers and sponsors for a dinner in an informal and pretty context, and enjoy a nice and relaxing evening in good company. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Conference day</span></h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following day, it was an early wake-up: the conference day started at 9:00 in the morning: we were happy to see lots of people coming in (250 tickets sold out) and eager to see what the event had in store for them. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">And much to the organisers&#8217; amazement, they were happy with the galvanizing speeches held in the two tracks and covering various popular topics, and happy to chat with the sponsors for new challenging ideas and projects.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As it always happens during WordCamps, it was nice to meet old friends and make new ones from anywhere in the world, but all from within the same tender community. </span></p>\n<blockquote><p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ausilia &#8220;The extraordinary fact of every WordCamp is that you always feel like in a family, whether you know people or you&#8217;re meeting them for the first time.

This was a well-attended day by local and also some international WordPress users. I popped in to see some familiar faces and make acquaintance with the organising team. For the afternoon I set up the YITH stand. This was followed by a speaker and sponsor dinner in the city centre. As a sponsor, it is really heartwarming to be appreciated for your contribution to the effort of making a WordCamp great.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1082312\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1082312\" style=\"width: 1000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1082312 size-full\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-2.png\" alt=\"The contributors day and social\" width=\"1000\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-2.png 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-2-300x84.png 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-2-768x215.png 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-2-261x73.png 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-2-311x87.png 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-2-363x102.png 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-2-270x76.png 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1082312\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Photos of the Contribution day, Meeting some familiar faces like Marcel Bootsman and on the right the full crew of volunteers, speakers and sponsors.</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>WordCamp Conference day</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The conference day was on Saturday 21st September… From 9 am, Dutch, Belgium German and many other nationalities of WordPressers started flooding in. For me, it was the first Dutch WordCamp and although I have been busy in the community, it was the first time to meet many of the familiar faces. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Marcel Bootsman, for example, is quite a well-known person since he walked to WordCamp EU last year in support of the mental health charity, WP&amp;UP. I finally managed to ask home some interesting questions about his efforts and journey. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Nijmegen is not far from Yoast HQ in Wychen. It was pretty much expected to bump into quite a few of the known contributor and community staff of Yoast. They and also Savvii are two of the supporters to their local WordPress Meetup, I learned. Furthermore, Olaf, who runs a web development company, was the Sponsor wrangler and has been a great support in helping us prepare for the event. There have been many more interesting people and conversation I had with many of the attendees and &#8216;you&#8217; are most certainly not forgotten. For YITH this is one of the most important factors to get feedback and build up new and stronger relations with users. It always astonishes me how popular the company is and I can assure you that this love is passed to the whole team our CEO, Nando Pappalardo. </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1082313\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1082313\" style=\"width: 1000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1082313 size-full\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-3.png\" alt=\"WordCamp Nijmgenen sponsors and volunteers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-3.png 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-3-300x84.png 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-3-768x215.png 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-3-261x73.png 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-3-311x87.png 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-3-363x102.png 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Copy-of-YITH-header-3-270x76.png 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1082313\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Sjoelen (a Dutch traditional game) with Yoast, Ronald and some organisers and an attempt to cotton sugar spinning</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The talks that were in the planning were varied and many tweeted Marieke van de Rakt’s talk about empowering women in the community. She had her eldest daughter on stage which must have been quite a nerve-wracking experience for her. Diversity and equality is such an important part for YITH too and we support every effort and conversation in this subject. Other talks and masterclasses were held over three different tracks and the feedback from the attendees was very positive. Many agreed that you sometimes get the most surprising and useful takeaways from the talks that you least expect it from. It’s an encouraging way to sometimes be brave and bold.</span></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\" lang=\"en\">She is my hero! <a href=\"https://t.co/R0Z6iikqRu\">https://t.co/R0Z6iikqRu</a></p>\n<p>— Marieke van de Rakt (@MariekeRakt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MariekeRakt/status/1175353656893480960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 21, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">After a busy day, we concluded the conference with a ‘borrel’ a Dutch way of describing drinks and snacks to finish off a fantastic day. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">It was one of the most intensive WordCamp days and by the time I arrived home, I was tired but satisfied.

YITH decided to sponsor New York City some time back as it worked out well in our busy calendar. Working out numbers, order swag and transport, flights, hotel and also a competition… it surprises us that it takes so much more time for each event. Yes, there is a moment where you doubt all is going to fall in to place, but when this happens and you arrive and all bags and boxes are delivered, the WordPress bug is back again… (Thank you, Laura, for helping me find the last box) It is something magical when you see new and familiar faces and you all have something in common. The love of WordPress! </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The welcome I received on Friday Night at the speaker and sponsor social was heartwarming. We had some delicious food and drink at a rooftop bar on Roosevelt Island. Just take a look at the picture of the view… it is not every day you get invited to these places with a view over Manhattan. But, sadly we soon had to get back to our hotels as it would be an early start… please remember that by that time it was actually 3 am since I left the UK that morning&#8230;</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1081092\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1081092\" style=\"width: 550px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1081092\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/IMG_20190913_202123-e1569271294752.jpg\" alt=\"View over Manhattan\" width=\"550\" height=\"310\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1081092\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Gorgeous view over Manhattan</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1081093\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1081093\" style=\"width: 550px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1081093\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MVIMG_20190913_202442-e1569271309791.jpg\" alt=\"WordCamp NYC speakers and sponsors\" width=\"550\" height=\"310\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1081093\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Pre WordCamp social for volunteers, speakers and sponsors</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>The Conference &#8211; two days of WordPress</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Day one is a usual early start for the organisers and sponsors… set up, and some much-needed coffee, with some traditional American breakfast from ‘Dunks’. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><br />\n</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Before you realize it is the turn of the attendees that have been eagerly waiting and started flooding in. The first half of the day felt like it went by within seconds. Hundreds of WordPress fanatics came to see me for not just our super cool t-shirts but also to strike a conversation and ask about the company. I must compliment the attendees for patiently waiting for their turns to speak to me… on numerous occasions, I saw people waiting but then moving to the next talk and after coming back. The chats I had were at times in-depth and challenging to either support or find a solution to the problems they’ve come up with. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">All throughout the event attendees made use of the so-called ‘hallway track’ to speak to sponsors and at times to pull a chair and show something on a laptop. </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1081100\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1081100\" style=\"width: 400px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1081100 size-full\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MVIMG_20190915_143639-e1569273791337.jpg\" alt=\"WordCamp New York City hallway track\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1081100\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ronald and Tim from Wordfence posing for a selfie</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1081097\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1081097\" style=\"width: 533px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1081097 size-full\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MVIMG_20190914_152409-e1569273714506.jpg\" alt=\"WordCamp New York City hallway track\" width=\"533\" height=\"300\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1081097\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WordCamp NYC attendees posing with YITH swag</figcaption></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The venue was at the Convene, near Times Square. An event space that was equipped and very experienced to deal with events like a WordCamp. This was very obvious during the lunchtimes when they managed to feed around 350 in about 20 to 25 minutes. The food was pretty and of outstanding quality.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We were treated to an ‘after-party’ social in a nearby bar where there was plenty of drink and finger food to be had. Probably a pretty normal bar for New York residents but for me it was a great and authentic experience with American football being shown on the screens and all different types of drinks being served. I think that anybody that made their way across the Atlantic was pretty much done by that time. For example, I was right awake by 4 am, which is in my local time of 9 am&#8230;</span></p>\n<h2>The Competition &#8211; two lucky winners</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Sunday was looking just as promising as Saturday with an excellent line-up of speakers across three tracks. Due to the popularity, I had run out of t-shirts and brochures the day before so the main thing was to talk to people and encourage the completion of our Wordsearch competition. Two lucky winners would be picked out for a chance to win a $50 Hard Rock Cafe gift voucher. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">At the closing remarks, the winners were announced by the organising lead, Mervin. Both winners were over the moon to win a Hard Rock Cafe gift voucher.</span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1081099\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1081099\" style=\"width: 800px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1081099 size-full\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/MVIMG_20190915_170927-e1569273746825.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1081099\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Ronald with the winners @MassandNancy and @NestEggSage</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"color: inherit;font-family: inherit;font-size: 24px\">Conclusion</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WCNYC is one WordCamp that will not easily be forgotten. Is it the location, city or the people? It is probably a mix of all. We have been made very welcome and the attendees have shown a real interest in the company and its plugins. We will no doubt be visiting more WordCamps in the US if not NYC again for next year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">As usual, it is important to highlight that WordCamps are organised by some very dedicated volunteers that spend many days preparing these great events. I think it is important to show our appreciation to the team lead by Mervin. So thank you to the organisers, volunteers, speakers, venue staff and everyone that attended,</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">I leave you with some impressions of WordCamp NYC and the many t-shirts that made lots of people very happy.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1081174 alignnone\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YITH-header.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YITH-header.jpg 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YITH-header-300x84.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YITH-header-768x215.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YITH-header-261x73.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YITH-header-311x87.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YITH-header-363x102.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/YITH-header-270x76.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<p>WordCamps and sponsoring these great events organised by volunteers is something that is very dear to us.

I often look at the list of contributors when a new WordPress release comes out to see how many I recognise. But it takes a much bigger community effort to keep the WP-ecosystem going. Talking to my colleagues, I realised that there is a lot of passion for WordPress in the company and I wanted to highlight some of the tireless contributing efforts the team has made in previous years.

Most of the contributor days happen either a day before or after a WordCamp conference. Depending on the size and the number of attendees, you will find several &#8216;tables&#8217; that specialise in tackling one of the many subjects. There is often a misconception that in order to contribute you need to be a seasoned developer. This is most certainly not the case. 10 members regularly support translations of themes and plugins, upload videos to WordPress TV, support user questions or even add patches to WordPress core.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-1065741 size-full alignnone\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/contributor.jpg\" alt=\"Team members contributing \" width=\"1000\" height=\"244\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/contributor.jpg 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/contributor-300x73.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/contributor-768x187.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/contributor-261x64.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/contributor-311x76.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/contributor-363x89.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/contributor-270x66.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h2><b>Other contributions</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many more ways to help WordPressers. The team regularly help users on their own platform as well as on the general WordPress forum and various Facebook groups, including Advance WooCommerce, WordPress plugin suggestions, and many more local ones. It doesn&#8217;t really matter how and where you help someone, as long as your knowledge makes someone richer, you have achieved something great.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Contribute without feeling constrained.

The CEO alone, Nando Pappalardo, has attended more than 40 WordCamps. The company makes sure that everyone gets the opportunity to attend WordCamps. At least 20 of the team attend WordCamp regularly as a sponsor with some exceeding 10+ WordCamps ranging from Bristol UK to Nashville, USA and WCEU. As the company is mainly based in Italy and Spain, there is not one WordCamp in these countries that have not seen one of the iconic YITH t-shirts.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1063067\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1063067\" style=\"width: 1000px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-1063067\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/04.jpg\" alt=\"WCEU 2019 Berlin - T-shirts madness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"798\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/04.jpg 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/04-300x239.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/04-768x613.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/04-261x208.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/04-311x248.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/04-363x290.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/04-270x215.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1063067\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">WCEU 2019 Berlin &#8211; T-shirts madness</figcaption></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><br />\nWhen asked why you enjoy attending WordCamps, Nando Pappalardo the CEO of YITH mentioned the common language that all attendees speak. “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For the energy and the wonderful people that can be known and to spend two days with people who speak your same &#8220;language&#8221;. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ausilia Arrigo noted the energy she gets out of attending WordCamps “WordCamps are a burst of energy, every time I attend one, I&#8217;m more motivated about using and learning more about WordPress and all the new possibilities it offers and that I can then apply to my job on a daily basis. Also, it&#8217;s the best occasion for networking and meeting WordPress lovers both on a national level and from around the world when it comes with bigger events like the WCEUs. </span></p>\n<p>I&#8217;d like to note that YITH has sponsored over 50 WordCamps and it is never about the cost and returns on investment. This article is not about a number or amount that has been invested, but more because of the sponsorship, thousands of attendees have managed to buy affordable and accessible tickets to attend a WordCamp. Obviously, it is important that YITH builds up a good reputation, but that is done through the quality of the plugins and not by the amount of money spent on sponsorship. As much that it is important to meet new customers it is just as important to meet existing ones. We enjoy hearing about their projects or even discuss solutions to new ones.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1062692\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1062692\" style=\"width: 649px\" class=\"wp-caption alignnone\"><img class=\"wp-image-1062692\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/OtherContributions.gif\" alt=\"\" width=\"649\" height=\"487\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1062692\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Organising WordCamps and Meetups is just as important as coding to make WordPress&#8230;</figcaption></figure>\n<h2><b>WordCamp Organising and Volunteering</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could argue that the biggest sacrifice in someone&#8217;s time is to organise a WordCamp.

WordCamp Catania being the greatest beneficiary of this wealth of WordCamp experience as three are on the organising team for this year&#8217;s edition (Francesco Grasso, Giuseppe Madaudo and Emanuela Castorina).

It takes quite a bit of preparation and not to speak about overcoming the nerves that many experiences, especially the first time. Seven of the team members have spoken at a WordCamp with talks ranging from plugin development, running a WordPress business to managing WooCommerce stores and SEO. I remember clearly that a good idea for talk is only the beginning. Preparing a full 30-minute talk, creating slides and the practicing of the talk can easily run into many days of prep.</span></p>\n<h2><img class=\"wp-image-1065743 size-full alignnone\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/speaking_etc.jpg\" alt=\"Speaking at a WordCamp\" width=\"1000\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/speaking_etc.jpg 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/speaking_etc-300x120.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/speaking_etc-768x307.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/speaking_etc-261x104.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/speaking_etc-311x124.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/speaking_etc-363x145.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/speaking_etc-270x108.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></h2>\n<h2><b>WordPress Meetups</b></h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from WordCamps pretty much the whole of the team attend regular meetups. For example, 9 attend the WordPress Catania Meetup and at least half are involved in organising, speaking or volunteering in some other way. Meetups are great to get involved with local WordPressers including business owners, developers, users, front end developers, copywriters and designers. Many WordPressers work alone and Meetups offer a way to interact with people that have the same passion as you. Even if the talks are not your forte, very often there is something you can pick from it anyway. Or as </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alberto Ruggiero </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">noted: “</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">because it&#8217;s a great occasion to network with other people and to learn something new each time”</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8220;I</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">t is important to make the WordPress ecosystem known to local communities, together we can grow” &#8211; Giuseppe Madaudo &#8211; Customer Support Manager</span></p></blockquote>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meetups are the next step in a local community and often the local Meetups will take the lead in organising local WordCamps. This is also the case for WordCamp Catania which will be held in September.</span></p>\n<blockquote><p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I love the networking about WP and non-WP things.

The tables and chairs provided in the middle of the main room created a good and buzzing atmosphere during lunch and breaks.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1072221\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WCBTN-food.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"945\" height=\"756\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WCBTN-food.jpg 945w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WCBTN-food-300x240.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WCBTN-food-768x614.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WCBTN-food-261x209.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WCBTN-food-311x249.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WCBTN-food-363x290.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/WCBTN-food-270x216.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 945px) 100vw, 945px\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The talks and speakers during this WordCamp were varied with topics ranging from Gutenberg development to mental health in the community and from time management to outsourcing work abroad. Being a sponsor often means that you get to miss out on the talks as there are always a few people who like to talk during the quieter times with the sponsors, or in other words ‘hallway track’.</span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Interesting discussions from the community</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Lots of strong supporters and ambassadors from the UK WordPress community were present which lead to some interesting conversations discussing future ideas on the running of WordCamps. Questions were asked whether enough new topics were being discussed? Whether speakers form outside of the WordPress community should be attracted? Mental and physical health was also high on the agenda plus the usual discussions after each talk had finished. You could literally join any group of people and discuss a different topic on any level during lunchtimes and breaks. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For YITH, the primary aim is to connect with local users and by sponsoring WordCamps we give something back to the community. The feedback and appreciation have been huge and we thank Brighton for welcoming us with open arms.</span></p>\n<h3>International WordPressers</h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">New contacts were made with international WordPressers including the organiser for WordCamp Dublin, WordCamp Dusseldorf and speakers of the WordCamps that YITH will be attending in the near future. These friendships will continue to grow the next time we’ll bump into each other. </span></p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">You can find us at the following upcoming events:</span></h4>\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"><a href=\"https://2019.nyc.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordCamp New York City</a> </span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2019.nijmegen.wordcamp.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WordCamp Nijmegen</span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2019.catania.wordcamp.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WordCamp Catania </span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2019.dublin.wordcamp.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WordCamp Dublin </span></a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2019.us.wordcamp.org\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">WordCamp US</span></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It would be great if we get to meet you at one of these WordCamp and make sure you let us know in advance.

This made it easy for attendees to enjoy the event and move between tracks, from a speech to the other, and visit the sponsors area and the lunch area.</p>\n<p>The contributor day was organised in two rooms, with a smart way to spot the right table: WordPress lovers crowded around the tables to contribute to every team of WordPress or simply to do some profitable networking.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1063066\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1063066\" style=\"width: 1000px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1063066 size-full\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03.jpg\" alt=\"WCEU 2019 Berlin - Contributor day\" width=\"1000\" height=\"498\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03.jpg 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-300x149.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-768x382.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-261x130.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-311x155.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-363x181.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/03-270x134.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1063066\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Opening remarks and some shots from the contributor day</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As sponsors, we were all placed in one big room right in front of the main track, which made it easy for the attendees to follow the speeches and talk with the sponsors during the breaks.</p>\n<p>Actually, it was a common feeling that people were spending time in the sponsors’ area all the time, which means they were interested in chatting with the sponsors and informing about what they can offer through WordPress. Despite that, people crowded the two tracks all the time&#8230; how can it be?

Our stand was a meeting point where many people, after breaking the ice, shared their projects, ideas, dreams, and ambitions with us.</p>\n<p>T-shirts we bring to the events just became a must. Many people wore the last two years&#8217; ones and approached our stand looking for the new ones. We have also met some collectors who have been knowing us for years and have all of our T-shirts!</p>\n<p>Everyone was excited about our new T-shirts “Keep calm and try turning it on and off again”. Indeed, we gave out over 700. We thought we brought so many but they kept on asking them even after the event was over and when we only had empty boxes left.</p>\n<p>The most amazing thing about this event was the cooperation among people who had a stand. We had the tangible and pleasant feeling to know each other since ever, to be everyone&#8217;s friends.</p>\n<p>We want to thank all the people who came especially to look for us at our stand and bring us their gadgets as we rarely went away (only to get some beer at the stand where they placed the beer tap). We really appreciated your help. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></p>\n<p><img class=\"wp-image-1059108 size-full aligncenter\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web-marketing-fetival-rimini-2019.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"562\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web-marketing-fetival-rimini-2019.jpg 1000w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web-marketing-fetival-rimini-2019-300x169.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web-marketing-fetival-rimini-2019-768x432.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web-marketing-fetival-rimini-2019-261x147.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web-marketing-fetival-rimini-2019-311x175.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web-marketing-fetival-rimini-2019-363x204.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/web-marketing-fetival-rimini-2019-270x152.jpg 270w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" /></p>\n<h2>And after the WMF&#8230;around Rimini in the evening</h2>\n<p>Every time we go to Rimini, we stay at the same hotel (the Baltic hotel) where we feel like at home and get spoiled by the owners Corrado and Lorella.</p>\n<p>Corrado is a funny guy who likes providing good company.

Okay, I might be a little bit biased here as I was one of the 9 organisers and coordinated the volunteers. But as always it takes a whole group of dedicated volunteers to put up a show. This time the number of attendees had grown to almost double, which meant a new location to accommodate this fantastic community. This is not an exaggeration as the vibe, inclusion, and accessibility meant that everyone felt welcome. There was also a big emphasis on creating a low carbon footprint and &#8216;being green&#8217;. I think few people would disagree that being conscious of these factors is a bad thing.</p>\n<h3>Day 1- the contributor day</h3>\n<p>The contributor day took place right by the water called The Pavilion, No1 Hannover Quay. Various contributions were made to WordPress from theme reviews to support and WordPress TV. However, I wonder how you could stay focused in such a lovely location and view. In the evening this was transformed to the social venue and to thank all the sponsors, volunteers, speakers and organisers.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047745\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047745\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047745 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs12-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs12-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs12-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs12-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs12-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs12-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs12-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs12.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047745\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Contributor day</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047738\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047738\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047738 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs05.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047738\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Volunteers ready to welcome attendees</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047741\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047741\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047741 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs08-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs08-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs08-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs08-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs08-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs08-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs08-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs08.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047741\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The YITH stand &#8211; ready to hand out swag</figcaption></figure>\n<h3>Day 2 &#8211; Conference day and after party</h3>\n<p>An early start for as I needed to set up the sponsorship table before the attendees would embark onto the University of Bristol&#8217;s Chemistry department. The location and venue was a big part of the success of this year&#8217;s WordCamp. Two lecture rooms, a quiet room and a huge space for all attendees to mingle with sponsors while drinking coffee or having lunch. It is usually the case that the first part of the day just flies by. Many WordPressers love a bit of swag and our #KeepCalmAndClearCache t-shirts did not disappoint the Bristol crowd. What was lovely to hear was that so many of those who came to see me are users of our plugins. This is one of the main reasons why we attend so many WordPress events, to meet you&#8230; It is also a great opportunity to hear feedback, discuss new launches and get ideas by talking to users.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047748\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047748\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047748 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs01-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs01-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs01-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs01-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs01-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs01-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs01-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs01.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047748\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Lots of interest from the attendees</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047744\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047744\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047744 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs11-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs11-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs11-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs11-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs11-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs11-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs11-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs11.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047744\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Vegetarian lunchtime buffet</figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047737\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047737\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047737 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs04-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"people socializing\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs04-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs04-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs04-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs04-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs04-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs04-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs04.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Evening social at the Watershed</figcaption></figure>\n<p>The evening social took place at the Watershed. You get the chance to catch up with old and new friends whilst reflecting on all the new things you&#8217;ve learned that day. &#8216;Make your own burritos&#8217; is a great way to feed a large group with various dietary requirements. The atmosphere was a bit too good to not finish the evening in various other bars down by the quay.</p>\n<h3>Day 3 &#8211; Conference day</h3>\n<p>Another fine and quiet morning marching up the hill for a slightly later start than the day before&#8230; For those that attended WordCamp Bristol, you probably regretted not getting a hotel higher up the hill as it was most certainly a steep one. As usual, the catering was set up and coffee and biscuits were welcoming the WordPressers that would attend day two. A whole day of 2 tracks with speakers lined up kept everyone wondering which talk to attend till the last moment. Often to make mental notes to catch up on the &#8216;other&#8217; talk on WordPress TV. As most YITH plugin users probably met up with Ronald on Saturday, it was more obvious that on Sunday it was the turn of WordPressers that wanted to find out more. This is just as important to us, as WordCamps are a great way to introduce new users to the extended world of WooCommerce.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047735\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047735\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047735 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs02-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"keepcalmandclearcache t-shirt\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs02-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs02-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs02-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs02-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs02-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs02.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047735\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Happy attendee <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047740\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047740\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047740 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs07-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"holding t-shirts\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs07-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs07-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs07-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs07-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs07-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs07-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs07.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047740\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">More happy attendees <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></figcaption></figure>\n<figure id=\"attachment_1047742\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-1047742\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><img class=\"wp-image-1047742 size-medium\" src=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs09-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs09-300x225.jpg 300w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs09-768x576.jpg 768w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs09-261x196.jpg 261w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs09-311x233.jpg 311w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs09-363x272.jpg 363w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs09-270x203.jpg 270w, https://yithemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/wcbrs09.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-1047742\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Who wouldn&#8217;t be happy with cool swag <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/1f609.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /></figcaption></figure>\n<h2>YITH as a gold sponsor of WordCamp Bristol</h2>\n<p>As a company, we felt honoured to be part of WordCamp Bristol and to be able to sponsor such a great and well-run event.</p>\n<p><strong>Thank you to each and every one of you</strong></p>\n<p>As much as I&#8217;d like to thank every person that made WordCamp Bristol possible, it would be an impossible task.

I call &#8217;em like I see &#8217;em. If your project is a dumpster fire, I&#8217;m going to say it&#8217;s a dumpster fire.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whenever someone comes to me in hopes that I review their product, I give them some form of the preceding paragraph.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if it is a plugin, theme, web host, or some other product.  What matters is that I write my review with honesty and offer my genuine opinion about the thing they built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rarely read most product reviews in the WordPress community anymore.  Far too often the reviewers are not offering their genuine experience with a product.  You get something like &#8220;XYZ is a multi-purpose theme that is built for…yadda, yadda, yadda…&#8221;  <em>Yawn</em>.  It reads as if publishers are trying to sell a product.  If you dig deep enough, you realize that is what many are doing (<em>hello, affiliate links</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also have it on good authority (I&#8217;ve seen some of the email exchanges) that a lot of money exchanges hands behinds the scenes for reviews.  Most of the time, publishers are not writing a review of the product.  They are selling you their dreams of a continued working relationship with the product maker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing wrong with affiliate links if a publisher loves a product.  There&#8217;s no issue with paid reviews if such reviews are honest experiences with the product.  There&#8217;s also no problem with writing a love letter to your favorite plugin and theme with no financial incentive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, what I generally see are shallow reviews at best.  Many, dare I say most, reviews are not genuine.  They are certainly not real journalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best place to find genuine reviews are from the user ratings on WordPress.org, assuming the plugin or theme is available there.  Users tend to not hold back, particularly if their review is negative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is tough as an artist (yes, I consider all programmers artists).  I&#8217;ve been on the receiving end of negative reviews of things I&#8217;ve built.  You learn to grow thick skin after a decade of putting your art out into the world.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was younger, I tended to be a bit hot-headed whenever I got a bad review for something I had built.  After pouring my heart and soul into a project, it cut deep to read a negative review.  I wasn&#8217;t always the most gracious receiver of such reviews.  There are responses I wish I could take back.  Looking at those times now, I wish I would have been more open to hearing what the reviewer was saying.  Even if I disagreed with every word, it did not mean that the person wasn&#8217;t providing me something of value with their review.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With age and I hope a little more wisdom, I usually give myself time to think about what someone is saying before I respond.  I allow my thoughts time to develop and mature.  Often, it turns out, critical reviews are far more helpful in making better art than all the five-star ratings in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I took the writing position at WP Tavern, I wanted to bring a review format to the website that is missing within our community.  I wanted to do reviews based on my experience as both a user and a developer.  I admit that I was not prepared for a negative reaction to what was in part a negative review.  As always, I gave myself time to read and think over what some commenters were saying.  This article is my response.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Reviews Are About Personal Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I learned early on as a writer is to not second guess myself, especially when writing an opinion piece.  It is not good for one&#8217;s mental health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An opinion piece is about the moment.  It is raw.  It is passionate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Writers&#8217; opinions may change over time.  They are human and have the freedom to change their minds later.  However, an opinion-based story should reflect that single moment in time and what the author&#8217;s feelings are at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a common (and wholly incorrect) notion that journalism should be nothing more than facts, that subjectivity is not allowed.  Throughout the several hundred years that some form of journalism has existed, there has never existed a point where the whole of the field was objective.  Even in the early days of U.S. journalism, my country&#8217;s founders published articles in newspapers to sway public opinion on ratifying the U.S. Constitution.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reporting, which is one form of journalism, does not represent the whole.  It is the most objective form of journalism in which the reporter simply tells the news to readers.  We certainly do plenty of that at the Tavern.  However, other forms like editorials, features, and reviews are as important.  These forms take a different approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reviews are the unwieldy beasts of journalism.  They are hard to tame.  They&#8217;re not always pretty.  However, they should always be true to their nature.  They can bring out angry hoards of fanboys down on the critic (ever read the comments of a critical review of an Apple product?).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Honest reviews are about personal experience.  If a film critic dislikes the latest movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it is that critic&#8217;s duty to write about their experience watching it.  The reviewer has an obligation to not huddle in fear of Iron Man fanatics who will inevitably send <em>ad hominem</em> attacks his way.  Holding back one&#8217;s opinion within a review is the ultimate sin of a critic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like with any products or forms of art, WordPress plugins and themes are not immune to this same criticism.  Such criticism is even more important when the software costs money and potential buyers may be looking for genuine reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disagreement with a review is OK.  Disagreements are more interesting than everyone nodding their heads in unison.  What a boring world it would be if we were all in agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I did want to address comments on my previous review about it being <em>unfair</em>, specifically the unfairness of my personal experience.  It&#8217;s that personal experience that makes a review genuine.  Not everyone&#8217;s experience will be the same.  One person&#8217;s one-star rating does not discount another&#8217;s five stars.  They are equally valid because they represent different experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developers Are Users Too</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a common idea in the WordPress community that developers are not users, that our experiences don&#8217;t count because our knowledge and skillsets are more advanced than the average.  At first glance, the argument makes some sense.  However, after giving it some serious thought, I reject the notion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Martin Scorsese can&#8217;t criticize films because he makes films.  There&#8217;s no way he can feel what the average person does at the cinema.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Beyoncé can&#8217;t judge a music competition because she&#8217;s a singer.  She&#8217;s not listening with the ears of a normal human.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wait; that&#8217;s not right, is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it that developers&#8217; opinions are so easily discounted when they are critical of user experience?  I use WordPress, different themes, and various plugins every day.  I use those that make me happy or serve essential functions.  I don&#8217;t necessarily pick plugins out because I like their code.  I use them because I too am a user in every way that a non-developer is a user.  Having the ability to articulate the problems from a different viewpoint doesn&#8217;t change that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, developers can provide more useful software reviews than &#8220;average&#8221; users because we have some past experience solving the same problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Offering a Genuine Review</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing you will always get from me is honesty.  When I review a WordPress-related product, you will always read about my personal experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was fully prepared to say that <em>the gloves are coming off</em>, but the gloves have always been off.  I will never hold back criticism.  I&#8217;m always ready to pile on the praise too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, I won&#8217;t lie to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who&#8217;s ready to have their theme or plugin reviewed next?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 18 Oct 2019 16:42:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: Chilean News Publication El Soberano First to Launch on Newspack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=95023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/chilean-news-publication-el-soberano-first-to-launch-on-newspack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9309:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />El Soberano homepage on the Newspack platform.</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Nine months after the <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2019/01/14/newspack-by-wordpress-com/\">announcement of Newspack</a> by WordPress.com, the Chilean news site <a href=\"https://elsoberano.org\">El Soberano</a> became the first publication to launch on the new platform.  On October 16, the small news team <a href=\"https://newspack.blog/2019/10/17/first-publisher-relaunches-using-newspack/\">relaunched with a fresh design</a> powered by the Newspack theme and its newsroom-focused plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Newspack is a project of Automattic, the parent company of WordPress.com.  Its goal is to work with leaders in the news industry to create a platform that brings WordPress to more newsrooms.  This year, the team behind Newspack has worked with several publications to address obstacles in journalism on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Newspack team was primarily advised by <a href=\"https://newspack.blog/2019/04/03/newspack-chooses-12-publishers-new-platform/\">12 publications during their first phase</a>.  Most of those publications are based in the U.S., but a few, such as El Soberano, are from other countries.  The Daily Maverick from Johannesburg, South Africa, and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting from California came on as advisers from the outset.  However, they may also launch on Newspack sometime in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We had 10 sites that we&#8217;re going to launch as soon as possible,&#8221; said Steve Beatty, head of Newspack Communications.  &#8220;Of the 10, one dropped out as they changed publishers. So that leaves El Soberano and eight others, and those eight should launch in the coming weeks &#8212; certainly by year&#8217;s end. We&#8217;ve got the next few queued up.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the initial phase, Beatty said the team was looking for small to medium-sized newsrooms that were covering local news or niche publications.  The development hurdles would likely have been much higher starting with large organizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We wanted newsroom leaders who were willing to experiment and try something bold and different, knowing that there was a very real chance of growing pains,&#8221; said Beatty. &#8220;The partners in our pilot newsrooms have been incredibly helpful, patient, understanding and cheerful. I&#8217;m not sure we screened for all that in the application process, but it&#8217;s worked out quite well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>El Soberano is a Fitting Launch Partner</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Content Director Roberto Bruna (left) and Executive Director Ana Arriagada (right).</div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com claims its &#8220;mission is to democratize publishing one website at a time.&#8221;  El Soberano, based in Santiago, is a smaller news publication with three people on the current full-time staff.  Their goal is to connect citizens with organizations that will help defend their rights.  The publication covers social movements within the country and to be an outlet for independent journalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In our news outlet we believe that only the organized people are sovereign of their destiny,&#8221; said Roberto Bruna, Content Director at El Soberano.  &#8220;Our name &#8216;El Soberano&#8217; is all about <em>el pueblo soberano</em>, the &#8216;sovereign people&#8217; in English.  For us, individual rights and freedoms are crucial. Then, things like a secular state and civil rights, such as the legalization of cannabis, homoparental adoption or the right to a safe abortion, are things we report about.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bruna further defined the publication&#8217;s goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>In El Soberano we defend an environment free of contamination; equal opportunities for women, ending the precariousness of their lives; a real pension system for citizens; sexual dissidence, to guarantee their equal rights and inclusion; a new development model based on innovation and knowledge; a secular state and freedom with critical thinking; urban planning and good housing solutions; consumers and a healthy and sustainable market and, finally, mechanisms that aim to create truly democratic constitutions for our countries.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>El Soberano does not give space for other interest groups because such groups have the means to make their opinions publicly available.  Instead, its mission is to report on social issues directly from citizens.  &#8220;In them lies the power of decision regarding the direction that our democracies must take,&#8221; said Bruna.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Launching El Soberano with Newspack</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the first publications to launch with a new system, it&#8217;s tough to be a pioneer when a lot is riding on success.  Ana Arriagada, Executive Director of El Soberano, was ready to take the news website to the next level after three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When we decided to take the next step and transform El Soberano into a sustainable environment, it was a great achievement for us to be chosen for the Newspack pilot with other eleven news outlets,&#8221; said Arriagada.  &#8220;We were the only news site in Spanish and from Latin America, so we felt very proud.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriagada has worked with the Newspack development team over the past six months to help guide them on what tools are needed to run a newsroom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision to apply for the Newspack pilot program was in part due to avoiding pitfalls they had seen with other digital media websites.  &#8220;Friends with their websites hijacked by a former &#8216;friend&#8217; developer when they try to move to a new platform, custom developments that only the author understood, huge invoices for maintenance hours, or even spending months working on a design that was not possible at the end,&#8221; said Arriagada.  They wanted to avoid other problems such as taking too long to apply changes to the homepage in the fast-paced world of journalism where new stories should be front and center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriagada said such problems were resolved with Newspack and their team can concentrate on editorial and revenue generation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>El Soberano originally launched on WordPress.com in January 2016.  Arriagada said it was nearly impossible to find a good selection of templates that were built specifically to solve the problems of the news industry.  &#8220;In Newspack we have the chance to combine different content blocks adapted to our needs, showing content in flexible ways,&#8221; said Arriagada.  &#8220;Now we have tools designed to generate revenue with the experience and best practices from world-class digital media.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arriagada called working with the Newspack team a &#8220;journey of discovery.&#8221;  In the beginning, it wasn&#8217;t clear how the team would use the information they were collecting from El Soberano and other publications or how the team would resolve issues based on the information provided.  Eventually, they received design proposals, which allowed them to get a feel for what they wanted and to further provide feedback to the Newspack team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Later, we received the access to the platform where we were able to play around, putting things in order, creating and implementing what we were looking for,&#8221; said Arriagada. &#8220;More feedback, corrections, hopes, and dreams.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She said that working with the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/newspack-blocks\">Content Blocks</a> system allowed her team to better create and assemble their homepage and articles.  &#8220;But maybe the most interesting thing for us,&#8221; said Arriagada, &#8220;was that Newspack team and other news sites from the pilot program proposed things that we don&#8217;t consider for our site, such as an ultra-flexible donation system or workflow systems. We see a lot of power in that collaborative way to develop a product.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future of Newspack</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Newspack launched <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/newspack-opens-up-application-process-for-phase-two\">phase two of its program</a> in July, which sought to bring 50 more newsrooms to the platform.  The new publications should be announced shortly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Both the initial pilot group and this group of 50 (or so) are part of the one-year development period, which ends on February 29,&#8221; said Beatty.  &#8220;We&#8217;re still determining what will happen on March 1. We&#8217;ll have a better sense of that when we start working with the 50 and see how quickly we can turn them around.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like much of Automattic&#8217;s work, it is open source and freely available to the public.  Newspack is a collection of packages to create a platform for newsrooms.  Of note are the following repositories.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/newspack-theme\">Newspack Theme</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/newspack-plugin\">Newspack Plugin</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/newspack-blocks\">Newspack Blocks</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers can find all eight plugins from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic?q=newspack\">Automattic GitHub page</a> if they want to give them a spin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Oct 2019 17:56:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WordPress.org blog: Empowering Generations of Digital Natives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=7413\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/empowering-generations-of-digital-natives/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8782:\"<p>Technology is changing faster each year. Digital literacy can vary between ages but there are lots of ways different generations can work together and empower each as digital citizens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No matter whether you’re a parent or caregiver, teacher or mentor, it’s hard to know the best way to teach younger generations the skills needed to be an excellent digital citizen. If you’re not confident about your own tech skills, you may wonder how you can help younger generations become savvy digital citizens. But using technology responsibly is about more than just technical skills. By collaborating across generations, you can also strengthen all your family members’ skills, and offer a shared understanding of what the internet can provide and how to use it to help your neighborhoods and wider society.&nbsp;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Taking Gen Z Beyond Digital Savvy</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Open up the dialogue</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you’re not fully confident in your own tech skills, you can help develop digital citizenship skills in others. If you feel comfortable during everyday conversation, you could describe a tech situation you have come across and ask family members if they have ever experienced something similar. You can give them a chance to share how they handled it or how it made them feel. This can help encourage them to think critically and to react with empathy. And being asked for advice can make them feel appreciated and empowered. But opening up the conversation can also be as simple as asking if they’ve seen anything online lately that they found interesting or wanted to talk about.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Share access to free and affordable training</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source content management systems have made online publishing accessible to a more diverse group of people. Dozens of content platforms offer hands-on training at no or low cost. <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/learning/topics/wordpress\">LinkedIn Learning</a>, and others have low-cost video libraries with thousands of recorded talks and workshops and the WordPress Training team have excellent downloadable lesson plans and materials. These platforms not only feature content that helps develop tech and content creation skills but also content around ethics, diversity and community building.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find a sense of community and belonging</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the disadvantages of increased digitalization is that <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/\">younger generations and us all may spend less time hanging out in-person.</a> Digital time spent with others is no replacement for in-person interactions. The awareness and mutual understanding which comes from back and forth interaction is needed for positive interpersonal skills. This is hard to replace in digital communities and those skills can only be learned with lots of hands-on practice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Learn the many benefits of volunteering&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are WordPress events across the world that provide a great place to learn new skills to share with your families and friends. Some work with schools and colleges to offer special events which are open to all ages. There are also plenty of small ways to volunteer with the WordPress project that can be done at home to practice new skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to attending events where you can learn skills and hang out with others with similar interests, the WordPress ecosystem offers countless opportunities to be actively involved. Professionals, hobbyists, and learners all make a difference by contributing to the ongoing creation of the WordPress platform. Together these people, who are known as contributors, form the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">WordPress open source community.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>WordPress is created by volunteer contributors</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not only are these contributors creating an amazingly flexible platform for all to use, it is an environment where you can continue to improve your skills, both technical and interpersonal. Open-source software projects can introduce you to people you would otherwise not get the chance to meet, locally and internationally. If you have a zest for learning, and for finding others to connect with, WordPress has many ways to meet contributors in person!</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>WordPress events are organized by volunteers</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress community events are volunteer-run. This can be a great way to give back to the project and practice all sorts of skills. Talk to your local event about how you could get involved and if you would like to bring older teenagers and young adults with you. You will not need any pre-existing tech skills to attend these events but they are a great way to discover areas you might want to learn more about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Contributor days offer a great opportunity to get involved</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>These events are specially designed to help you get involved in building the open-source WordPress platform. You can collaborate with other members of its community and find areas that are right for you to use and grow your skills. All of the tasks you will discover at an event can be continued at home and some are easy to get other family members involved in learning and adding in ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors come from all sorts of backgrounds and locations, some may live near you and others thousands of miles away. Working alongside lots of different cultures and countries can open up new ideas for young people letting them learn new ways of doing things and discover different perspectives. All those different perspectives can cause misunderstandings. But being involved in a global learning community is a great way to practice communicating across cultural boundaries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Getting involved can be rewarding in many (unexpected) ways</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The most rewarding part of actively taking part in WordPress events is making budding friendships. New connections often turn into long-lasting friendships that are likely to continue for years to come, both online and offline. With a global community, these friendships can potentially lead to lots of international adventures too!</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Getting ready for the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WordCampBTN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@WordCampBTN</a>.

It can also help you make us make more informed decisions. The more we interact with a diverse range of people, the more empathic we become. Some of the most valuable learning that can be offered to Gen Z (and probably to all of us at times) is that what we come across in fast-moving digital communities isn’t always the entire view.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>All things considered….</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone who is a digital native may not need encouragement to obtain tech skills. But they may not be aware that digital communities are still communities and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/responsible-participation-in-online-communities/\">we need to use the same sorts of people skills for both offline and online locations</a>. Opening up conversations about situations they may experience online that may require them to (re)act responsibly, can encourage them to think critically and act with empathy. Compared to previous generations, digital natives spend substantially more time by themselves while using devices, so encouraging them to join real-life communities, such as WordPress, could be the first step to learning what it means to be a good digital citizen!  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/yvettesonneveld/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>yvettesonneveld</a> &amp; Annemarie de Haan</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Oct 2019 20:03:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Yvette Sonneveld\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: Mark Davies Joins Automattic as Chief Financial Officer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=95009\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/mark-davies-joins-automattic-as-chief-financial-officer\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4364:\"<p>Automattic, the company behind WordPress.com, WooCommerce, and various other products, announced earlier today that Mark Davies has joined the team as its Chief Financial Officer (CFO).  This news comes fresh off the heels of Automattic&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-tumblr-plans-to-rebuild-the-backend-powered-by-wordpress\">acquisition of Tumblr</a> in August and a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-raises-300m-in-series-d-investment-round-valuation-jumps-to-3-billion\">$300 million Series D investment</a> from Salesforce Ventures in September.  The investment round gave the company a $3 billion valuation after the funding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davies graduated from Western Washington University with a bachelor&#8217;s degree in accounting and earned his MBA in finance at Arizona State University.  He has since worked for large companies in key roles.  Prior to taking the position with Automattic, Davies served as the CFO at Vivint, a North American smart home technology company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vivint was founded in 1999 and claims over $1 billion in annual revenue.  In 2012, The Blackstone Group <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-blackstone-acquisition/blackstone-buys-security-firm-vivint-for-over-2-billion-idUSBRE88I0LF20120919\">purchased the company for over $2 billion</a>.  Davies came on board in 2013 and would have played a large role in growing the company&#8217;s annual revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vivint announced on October 15 that Davies <a href=\"http://investors.vivint.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2019/Vivint-Smart-Home-Announces-CFO-Transition/default.aspx\">was leaving the company</a>.  &#8220;Mark has created a talented and experienced finance team with a solid track record of growth and financial discipline,&#8221; said Todd Pedersen, co-founder and CEO of Vivint Smart Home. &#8220;We thank him for his six years with the company and wish him the best in his next role.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before joining Vivint, Davies served as president of global business services with Alcoa.  He was also a member of the Alcoa Executive Council.  Prior to that position, he spent 12 years at Dell Inc. in various roles.  His most recent position was as the managing vice president of strategic programs.  He earlier served as the CFO of Dell&#8217;s Global Consumer Group, which is a $14 billion enterprise with operations across the world.  He held positions with Applied Materials and HP earlier in his career.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Davies should play a key role in helping Automattic grow beyond its current levels of revenue.  He has the credentials and experience to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Automattic is creating the operating system for the web, from websites to ecommerce to social networks,&#8221; said Matt Mullenweg, founder and CEO of Automattic and co-founder of WordPress. &#8220;As we zoom past 1,100 employees in over 70 countries, we wanted a financial leader with experience taking businesses from hundreds of millions in revenue to billions and even tens of billions, as Mark has. I&#8217;m excited about working alongside such an experienced leader day-to-day to build one of the defining technology companies of this era.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg if often cited saying that he would like to see WordPress have an 85% share of the web.  Currently, WordPress runs over 34% of the top 10 million websites.  Automattic would certainly play a role in pushing the platform toward that lofty goal.  He and David Heinemeier Hansson <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-and-david-heinemeier-hansson-discuss-wordpress-market-share-monopolies-and-power-in-open-source-communities\">discussed the dynamics of power</a> in open source communities and whether such a goal was healthy for the web earlier this month.  In the discussion, Mullenweg clarified that 85% was a &#8220;trailing indicator&#8221; rather than a goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stuart West served as Automattic&#8217;s CFO for the last seven years.

WordPress 5.3 is currently scheduled to be released&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>November 12, 2019</strong>, but we need&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;help to get there—if you haven’t tried 5.3 yet, <strong>now is the time</strong>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.3 release candidate: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (choose the “bleeding edge nightlies” option)</li><li>Or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.3-RC1.zip\">download the release candidate here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s in WordPress 5.3?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.3 expands and refines the <strong>Block Editor</strong> introduced in WordPress 5.0 with <strong>new blocks, more intuitive interactions, and improved accessibility</strong>.

WordPress introduced a tool to independent and small publishers who did not have the resources of the larger publishing platforms. Access to a free content management system to create websites has empowered thousands of people to find their voice online. People have been able to share their enthusiasm for hobbies, causes, products and much more. Through these different voices, we can encourage understanding, spark creativity, and create environments where collaboration can happen. But as we build more digital communities, it&#8217;s easy to forget that online safety is a group effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital literacy is also part of being a good digital citizen, but it’s more than just being able to do basic actions with your mobile device. Digital literacy refers to the range of skills needed to do online research, set up web accounts, and find solutions for fixing devices among other things. But to be able to enjoy more of the digital world safely and responsibly &#8211; to be a good digital citizen &#8211; we need to be able to:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>navigate</strong> vast amounts of information without getting overwhelmed;</li><li><strong>evaluate</strong> a variety of perspectives;</li><li><strong>connect</strong> with people with respect and empathy;</li><li><strong>create</strong>, curate and share information.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We will need our offline analytical and social skills to make that happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Here’s some best practices our community members have shared!</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Online or offline, let empathy be your compass</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The hardest part about all of this is the anonymity of online interactions. Without that face-to-face feedback of saying something mean to another person&#8217;s face, it&#8217;s easy to upset the people you&#8217;re trying to communicate with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In our daily lives in the offline world, comments may be more tempered and slow to anger  in disagreements. Visual cues will help us determine how a remark is perceived. That, in turn, helps us adjust our behaviour Action, reaction, it’s how we learn best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Online, however, the experience is different. A keyboard does not protest if we type angry, hate-filled messages. A screen does not show any signs of being hurt. The lack of physical human presence combined with the anonymity of online alter-egos can be a formula for disrespectful and unfriendly behavior. It is good to remind ourselves that behind the avatars, nicknames and handles are real people. The same empathy we display in our in-person interactions should apply online as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Critically evaluate your sources&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We all have times when we consume information with limited research and fact-checking. For some of us, it feels like there’s no time to research and compare sources when faced by a sea of online information. For others, there may be uncertainty about where to start and what to consider. But, without a bit of skepticism and analytical thinking, we run the risk of creating narrow or incorrect understanding of the world. With a little effort we can curb the sharing of fake news and biased information, particularly on topics that are new to us or that we’re not familiar with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Misinformation can spread like wildfire. Ask these simple questions to evaluate information online:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>who is the source of the information?</li><li>is it plausible?</li><li>is the information fact or just an opinion?</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Own our content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this day and age, it’s never been easier to just copy, paste and publish somebody else&#8217;s content. That doesn’t mean that we should! Publishing content that is not truly ‘yours’ in wording and tone of voice is unlikely to build a connection with the right audience. But, just as important, using someone else’s content may breach copyright and potentially intellectual property rights. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information about intellectual property, <a href=\"https://www.wipo.int/about-ip/en/\">visit the World Intellectual Property Organization website</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Don’t breeze past terms and conditions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Have you ever signed up for an online service (to help you distribute published content or accept payments) that was offered at no cost? In our fast-paced digital lives, we tend to want to breeze past terms and conditions or warning information and often miss important information about what will happen with our data. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we are given a contract on paper, we tend to read and re-read it, giving it a greater priority of our time. We may send it to other people for a second opinion or seek further review before signing. Remarkably, we rarely do that with online agreements. As a result, we may be putting our online privacy and security at risk. (WordPress uses a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/gpl-primer/\">GPL license</a>, and only collects usage data that we never share ever.).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keep your website safe and healthy</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you would like to own your voice online, you also need to protect your reputation by securing your publishing platform. Websites can face security attacks. Hackers may seek to obtain access through insecure settings, outdated plugins and old software versions, and in extreme cases can try to scam your visitors. And leaking customer data, may even lead to legal consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, websites ‘flagged’ for security issues, can lead to high bounce rates and eventual loss of search rankings. This can all affect how search engines rate or even block your site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Good practices to keep your website safe include changing your safe password regularly, installing security software, an SSL certificate and keeping the core software, plugins and themes up to date. This will not guarantee that you will keep hackers out, so always keep several backups of your site, ideally both offline and online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is just website security in a tiny nutshell. If you would like to learn more about keeping websites safe, you may want to check out some of these resources and many more videos at WordPress.tv.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Join in and help make the web a better place!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of Digital Citizenship Week, we would like to encourage you to learn and share skills with your colleagues, friends and family members. That way, we all become more informed of potential issues and how to reduce the risks. Together we can make it easier to navigate the web more effectively and securely!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Additional resources</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Site health check</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 introduced pages in the admin interface to help users run health checks on their sites.

Oztaskiran said the partnership is not an acquisition but rather a unification of efforts that may eventually result in combining under the same name.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our short term plan is to work on each other&#8217;s plugins to improve them according to our individual areas of expertise (me in design, marketing and user happiness, him in development and more technical stuff where I fall short), and then fully collaborate on plugins and themes,&#8221; Oztaskiran said.</p>\n<p>Gutenslider will remain a standalone plugin and will not be merged into Kioken Blocks. Both products will share similar resources in terms of functionality and support. The team plans to work on porting their products to be ready for WordPress.org&#8217;s upcoming Block Directory. Pro users of Kioken Blocks will be able to use the pro functionalities of Gutenslider and the team plans to make Gutenslider work like an extension to Kioken Blocks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Gutenslider is pretty extensive at it is, and we thought it deserves to keep going as a standalone block and plugin, since it will be also available in the upcoming Block Directory for Gutenberg,&#8221; Oztaskiran said. &#8220;We will handle it as another product even though it is under the same roof as Kioken Blocks. We will continue adding new features to that block and improve the experience and Kioken Blocks will gain new blocks as well, but not as extensive as Gutenslider. There&#8217;s a possibility we could rename the block but that&#8217;s not the case at the moment.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Oztaskiran said he sees a lot of possibilities in Gutenslider, because it is not just an image and video slider but capable of adding different types of block content on top of the slides, such as paragraphs, headings, images, galleries, products, and more.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;Since the future of Gutenberg, as we see it, is going to be shaped around the Block Directory in the editor, our plan is focusing more blocks on that directory, with the Kioken Blocks as a builder on top of them as a plugin,&#8221; Oztaskiran said. &#8220;The final goal is building an ecosystem for WordPress users who have adopted the new editor &#8211; products, plugins and themes with a streamlined interface and experience. Dev partnerships are the first step of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Oztaskiran could not confirm if the product catalog will be combining under one company name. The final decision has not yet been made but he said it is likely that they will combine under the Kioken branding sometime in the future for marketing their WordPress products.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 19:03:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.2.4 Release Addresses Several Security Issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94983\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-2-4-release-addresses-several-security-issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2982:\"<p>The core WordPress team released version 5.2.4 of WordPress on October 14.  The release addresses six security issues that were all privately reported through WordPress&#8217; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">responsible disclosure procedure</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like any security release, users should update immediately to the latest version to keep their sites secure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those with automatic updates enabled, the new version is already rolling out to sites. All major branches of WordPress from version 3.7 to 5.2 received the new security fixes. If automatic updates are not enabled, users should update from the &#8220;Updates&#8221; screen under &#8220;Dashboard&#8221; in the WordPress admin.  Otherwise, users can download WordPress from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/release-archive/\">release archive</a> and manually <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/updating-wordpress/\">run an update</a> to make sure their site is not at risk to what are now publicly-known vulnerabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/wordpress-5-2-4-security-release/\">release announcement</a>, the following security issues were noted. They were corrected in all updated versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) could be added from the Customizer screen.</li><li>An issue that allowed stored XSS to inject JavaScript into <code>&lt;style></code> tags.</li><li>A bug that allowed unauthenticated posts to be viewed.</li><li>A method to use the <code>Vary: Origin</code> header to poison the cache of JSON <code>GET</code> requests (REST API).</li><li>A server-side request forgery (SSRF) with how URLs are validated.</li><li>Issues with referrer validation in the WordPress admin.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers who want to dive more into the code changes, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/wordpress-develop/compare/5.2.3…5.2.4\">changeset is available on GitHub</a>.  Most changes should not affect plugins or themes.  However, it is worth noting that the <code>static</code> query property was removed in this release.  This removal affects both the <code>WP</code> and <code>WP_Query</code> classes.  Developers should test their plugins against this version to make sure nothing is broken if their projects rely on this property.  It is unlikely that many plugins rely on this query variable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2.4 also includes a couple of other bug fixes.  One <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/46074\">removes a line of code</a> that makes an extra call to the <code>wp-sanitize.js</code> script in the script loader.  The second fix <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/46473\">addresses an issue</a> where the directory path wasn&#8217;t normalized on Windows systems, which led to the <code>wp_validate_redirect()</code> function removing the domain. This fixes a bug created in WordPress 5.2.3.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 15:52:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"WPTavern: Meetup.com Introduces RSVP Fees for Members, WordPress Meetup Groups Unaffected by Pricing Changes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94958\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://wptavern.com/meetup-com-introduces-rsvp-fees-for-members-wordpress-meetup-groups-unaffected-by-pricing-changes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4936:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Meetup</a>, a subsidiary of <a href=\"https://www.wework.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WeWork</a>, has announced a significant change to its pricing structure that will require members to pay a $2 fee in order to RSVP to events. The change will go into effect in October, ostensibly to distribute meetup costs more evenly between organizers and members. Some meetup organizers have received the following <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/lp/paymentchanges?mpId=9038\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">message</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Meetup is always looking for ways to improve the experience for everyone in our community. One of the options we are currently exploring is whether we reduce cost for organizers and introduce a small fee for members.</p>\n<p>Beginning in October, members of select groups will be charged a small fee to reserve their spot at events. The event fee can be paid by members or organizers can cover the cost of events to make it free for members.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Organizers have the option to subsidize the $2 fee for members who RSVP so that it is entirely free for those who attend, but for popular groups this can become cost prohibitive. If 1,000 members RSVP for an event, the organizer would owe $2,000 to host it.</p>\n<p>The new pricing does not apply to non-profit groups or Pro Networks. WordPress community organizer Andrea Middleton has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andmiddleton/status/1183868783116472320\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that Meetup&#8217;s pricing changes will not affect groups that are part of the <a href=\"http://meetup.com/pro/wordpress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">official WordPress chapter</a>. In 2018, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/04/18/2018-meetup-survey/\">WordPress had 691 meetup groups in 99 countries</a> with more than 106,000 members. According to Meetup.com, groups in the official chapter now number 780 in 2019. Middleton encouraged any outlying WordPress meetup groups to join the official chapter by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/meetup-program-basics/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">submitting an application</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-14-at-9.28.03-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Meetup organizers and members who are affected by the pricing hike are unhappy about the changes. If the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/securestep9/status/1183798804371386369\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">angry responses on Twitter</a> are any indication, people are leaving the platform in droves. Many organizers have announced that they are cancelling their subscriptions and looking to migrate to other platforms, such as <a href=\"https://kommunity.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> Kommunity</a> or <a href=\"http://gettogether.community\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">gettogether.community</a>, an open source alternative for managing local events.</p>\n<p>No competitor has the reach or brand recognition that Meetup has. Some groups will inevitably resort to using Eventbrite or Facebook to manage local meetups but neither of these are focused on promoting or growing these types of local events. Discovery and new meetup marketing are Meetup.com&#8217;s forte, but the platform has been fairly stagnant when it comes to improving the user experience.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This new move is quite onerous on users, and WP is lending support to the platform, which is proprietary and for-profit,&#8221; Morten Rand-Hendriksen <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1183853556647903232\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;The optics and messaging are not great. When tools we use start to act in problematic ways, and we keep using them, we are tacitly agreeing to and even promoting that behavior even if it is not directly affecting us.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Andrea Middleton responded, acknowledging that WordPress&#8217; use of certain platforms will sometimes involve compromise.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true that WordPress contributors use various proprietary and for-profit tools to help us achieve various outreach and coordination goals,&#8221; Middleton said. &#8220;I think we strive for a balance between expediency and idealism, but of course any compromise results in a loss of one or the other.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Given the immediate backlash following Meetup.com&#8217;s announcement of the pricing changes, it would not be surprising to see the decision reversed. The company characterized the move as an &#8220;exploration&#8221; and plans to roll it out gradually to more meetups. For organizers who are looking to charge more on top of the fee to cover event costs, Meetup said this feature is coming soon.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 15 Oct 2019 04:12:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.2.4 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=7372\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/wordpress-5-2-4-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3666:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.2.4.zip\">WordPress 5.2.4</a> is now available!

OpenJS was formed by a recent merger between the JS Foundation and the Node.js Foundation. AMP will join webpack, jQuery, Mocha, Node.js, ESLint, Grunt, and other open source projects that have OpenJS as their legal entity.</p>\n<p>Over the past year, AMP has been evolving its governance, moving to an open, consensus-seeking governance model in 2018, similar to the one <a href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/about/governance/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">adopted by the Node.js project</a>. One of the primary objectives of changing AMP&#8217;s governance and moving to a foundation was to foster a wider variety of contributions to the project and its technical and product roadmap. The incubation process will address AMP&#8217;s lack of contributor diversity and inclusion, as only past or current Google employees have commit rights on the code base.</p>\n<p>In recognition of how the project&#8217;s connection to Google has been problematic for adoption, the company is transferring AMP&#8217;s domains and trademarks to OpenJS, which is a vender-neutral organization, as outlined in the FAQs of OpenJS&#8217; <a href=\"https://openjsf.org/blog/2019/10/10/openjs-foundation-welcomes-amp-project-to-help-improve-user-experience-on-the-web/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The OpenJS Foundation prides itself on vendor neutrality. Our vested interest resides solely in the ecosystem and the projects that contribute to that ecosystem. The OpenJS Foundation’s Cross Project Council is committed to supporting AMP in addressing these issues and ensure continued progress. During onboarding, AMP will also go through a multi-step process including adopting the OpenJS Foundation Code of Conduct, transferring domains and trademarks and more to graduation from incubation. AMP has made incredible strides by adopting a new governance model and by joining the OpenJS Foundation, they’ve made their intentions clear-AMP is committed to its vision of “A strong, user-first open web forever.”</p></blockquote>\n<p>Google is, however, a Platinum member of the OpenJS Foundation with annual dues of more than $250K per year. This membership guarantees the company direct participation in running the Foundation, a guaranteed board seat, and have a direct voice in budget and policy decisions. Google plans to maintain its team of employees who contribute full time to the AMP project.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tobie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tobie Langel</a>, a member AMP&#8217;s advisory committee, one of the changes in moving to the OpenJS Foundation is AMP&#8217;s governance model will no longer be under the purview of Google and the ultimate goal is that Google will cease funding AMP directly. Instead, the company will direct funds through the foundation and work to remove the project&#8217;s Google dependencies for its infrastructure and tooling.</p>\n<h3>OpenJS Aims to Disentangle AMP Runtime from Google Cache</h3>\n<p>Gaining full infrastructural independence from Google will be no small feat for AMP contributors. The OpenJS Foundation&#8217;s announcement states that one of the long term goals in moving the project over is to disentangle the AMP runtime from the Google AMP Cache:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The end goal is to separate the AMP runtime from the Google AMP Cache. The Project is currently in the incubating stage and Project leaders are still determining the next steps. Ideally, hosting and deployment of the AMP runtime to the CDN would fall under the purview of the OpenJS Foundation, much like the foundation is handling other projects CDNs, such as the jQuery CDN.  </p>\n<p>Untangling the runtime from the cache is a complex endeavor requiring significant investments of time and effort which would be planned and implemented in collaboration with the foundation and industry stakeholders during and after incubation.</p>\n<p>The OpenJS Foundation CPC is committed to having a long-term strategy in place to address this issue by the end of AMP’s incubation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>AMP is used on more than <a href=\"https://blog.amp.dev/2018/02/13/amps-new-horizons/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">30 million domains</a>. While many see this news as a positive move towards AMP&#8217;s eventual independence from Google, it doesn&#8217;t remove Google&#8217;s power to compel publishers to support the AMP standard by prioritizing AMP pages in search results. The news was received with skepticism by commenters on <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21242890\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hacker News</a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/dhgwlb/google_takes_amp_to_the_openjs_foundation/f3nxmq0/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Reddit</a>, who deemed it &#8220;mostly meaningless window-dressing,&#8221; given how aggressively Google is pushing AMP in its search engine. AMP remains deeply controversial and moving it to a foundation that is heavily financially backed by Google is not enough to win over those who see it as Google&#8217;s attempt to shape the web for its own interests.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 20:52:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Inside Look at GoDaddy’s Onboarding Process for Managed WordPress Hosting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94901\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/inside-look-at-godaddys-onboarding-process-for-managed-wordpress-hosting\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8199:\"<p>The Tavern was provided access to test GoDaddy&#8217;s onboarding process, which is a part of its <a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/offers/wordpress-hosting\">managed WordPress hosting</a> service.  The company has revamped its system since we <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-launches-new-onboarding-experience-for-wordpress-customers\">covered it in 2016</a>.  The web host has had time to garner feedback since then and build an easy-to-use, headache-free way to launch WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy has been making waves in the WordPress community over the past few years and is quickly becoming one of the most dominant businesses in the ecosystem.  Several of the company&#8217;s free WordPress themes consistently rank in the theme directory&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/browse/popular/\">popular list</a>.  Most of them are child themes of their popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/primer/\">Primer theme</a>, which boasts 40,000+ active installs when not counting child theme installs.  The real count should be north of 200,000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy provided access to its Pro 5+ tier, which is its highest level of managed WordPress hosting.  They have three lower tiers, each at different price points and with fewer features.  Regular pricing for the tiers range between $9.99 and $34.99 per month.  All levels include automatic backups, security scans, caching, and a slew of other features that are not always easy to figure out for new users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aaron Campbell , GoDaddy’s head of WordPress Ecosystem &amp; Community, said that their hosting service is growing quickly.  &#8220;We were among the largest WordPress hosts when we launched our Managed WordPress Hosting in 2014,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;Within 2 years our offering became the largest Managed WordPress platform in the world and remains so to this day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy launched its basic onboarding process later in 2014.  They iterated on that version through 2018.  &#8220;When Gutenberg went into core in WordPress 5.0 we saw an opportunity to redefine the WordPress onboarding and imagine what a &#8216;Gutenberg native&#8217; experience would look like,&#8221; said Campbell.  &#8220;Meaning, do what Gutenberg uniquely enables us to do over what was possible before&#8211;things that couldn&#8217;t be done by making existing themes Gutenberg &#8216;compatible&#8217; we had to build from the ground up.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on my experience with the product, I would have no qualms about recommending it to new or even more experienced users.  Even those with no experience running WordPress can create a new site without trouble in far less time than it&#8217;d take to go through the normal, more complex process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Onboarding Process Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the hardest things to know prior to signing up for a service and handing over your credit card number is how the service works. For this reason, I snagged a few screenshots and will do a quick walk-through of the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you are ready to build your new website, the service provides a &#8220;Set up&#8221; link that sends you to GoDaddy&#8217;s onboarding screen.  There are three paths to choose from.  The first and most prominent is to view the available templates, which is the path that new users would choose.  You can also manually set up WordPress or migrate an existing site.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When selecting to view templates, the service presents over 50 options to choose from.  The templates are further grouped by category based on the type of site a user might want to create.  I chose the &#8220;Beckah J.&#8221; option because it worked for my idea of creating a life-wellness site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each of the templates are created from GoDaddy&#8217;s new Go WordPress theme, which is currently <a href=\"https://github.com/godaddy-wordpress/go\">available via GitHub</a> and <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/75007\">awaiting review</a> for placement in the official WordPress theme directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After selecting a template, the process moves to a preview screen, which has buttons to switch between desktop, tablet, and mobile views.  From that point, you can choose to use the template or go back and select another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was the first point of the process that felt like it needed polishing.  The preview frame was too small to get a feel for what the site would look like on desktop or tablet.  This is a fixable problem.  There&#8217;s plenty of screen real estate GoDaddy could use to make the preview nicer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The next screen allows users to enter information about what type of site they want to run. Depending on which of the following checkboxes are ticked, GoDaddy will set up the site differently.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Provide information</li><li>Write blog posts</li><li>Display my portfolio</li><li>Sell physical goods to my customers</li><li>Sell digital goods to my customers to download</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After completing the final form, GoDaddy begins creating the site.  The host sets up the site with one or more of several plugins based on the choices made in the previous form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site installation process was slower than I had expected.  We live in a fast-paced world where users expect things to happen nearly instantly.  I admit I was antsy while waiting for the process to complete, in part because everything else happened so quickly.  I wondered if I had time to grab a sandwich.  In reality, it was much faster than manually setting up a WordPress install, but the setup did take a few minutes of waiting.  My experience may have been an anomaly too.  Sometimes these things take time.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Website Ready to Go</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the box, my newly-created site had five custom pages ready based on my choices during the onboarding process.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Blog</li><li>Get in Touch</li><li>Home</li><li>My Account</li><li>My Cart</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It was nice to see WooCommerce ready and a contact form set up with my email (handled by the CoBlocks plugin). I would rather have seen <code>contact</code>, <code>account</code>, and <code>cart</code> page slugs for their respective pages, but that&#8217;s a personal preference.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site came with seven plugins installed, five of which were activated.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Akismet (deactivated)</li><li>CoBlocks</li><li>Gravity Forms (deactivated)</li><li>Sucuri Security</li><li>WooCommerce</li><li>WP101 Video Tutorials</li><li>Yoast SEO</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\">CoBlocks</a> along with theme integration for the block editor is what made the process of working with the website a breeze.  GoDaddy <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\">acquired the CoBlocks plugin</a> in April.  At the time, the plugin had 30,000+ active installs.  It has since grown to 80,000+ in the few months since GoDaddy has taken over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Onboarding Process Provides a Nice User Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been critical of GoDaddy over the years.  I am a customer of one of their other hosting products that launched years ago.  That particular site is stuck on PHP 5.6, which has given me the feeling that the company is not focused on its older projects.  However, Campbell said they are in the process of moving users on legacy hosting products to a newer platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been cautiously optimistic about the work GoDaddy has been doing within the WordPress community.  They&#8217;ve more than shown their commitment to the WordPress platform over the past few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a couple of minor hiccups, the onboarding process the hosting giant has built is one of the best experiences I have ever had launching a WordPress site.  Even as an old pro, I&#8217;d consider using it for future projects, particularly when setting up sites for less tech-savvy family and friends.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 14 Oct 2019 20:30:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WordPress.org blog: Becoming Better Digital Citizens Through Open Source\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=7353\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/becoming-better-digital-citizens-through-open-source/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7957:\"<p>The WordPress Project is on a mission to democratize publishing. As WordPress empowers more people to participate in the digital space, we have the opportunity to make sure that everyone can participate safely and responsibly. Today marks the start of Digital Citizenship Week. We are going to share how open source can be used as a tool for learners (regardless of age) to practice and model the essential parts of being a good digital citizen.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is digital citizenship?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The digital landscape constantly changes and this affects the way we use the internet. New platforms emerge, people find different ways to spread information, communities form, grow and fade away every day. The concepts and practice of promoting civil discourse, critical thinking and safe use of the internet still remain central. And that is exactly what digital citizenship is about.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“Put simply, digital citizenship is a lot like citizenship in any other community &#8212; the knowledge of how to engage with digital communities you’re part of in a way that is thoughtful, safe, and makes appropriate use of the technology.”</em></p><cite><em>Josepha Haden, Executive Director WordPress Project</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who is a digital citizen?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital Citizenship is for all age groups. Anyone who uses the internet on a computer, mobile device or a TV is a digital citizen. You don’t have to be tech-savvy already, maybe you are taking your first steps with technology. Digital Citizenship Week is a chance to reflect together on our impact on the digital world. It can help us to make our consumption more considered and our interaction friendlier. It enables us to make a positive difference to those around us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of us can strive (or learn) to become better digital citizens. It can be affected by the access those teaching have had to digital skills and good practice. Adult education classes and community tech hubs play a part in basic tech skill development. Unfortunately, these are not always accessible to those in less populated geographic locations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Open source communities like WordPress already make a difference in encouraging the principles of digital citizenship, from sharing tech skills to improving security knowledge. They give people an opportunity to learn alongside their peers and many of the resources are available regardless of location, resources, or skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>WordPress Meetups &#8212; locally-based, informal learning sessions &#8212; typically take place monthly on weekday evenings. </li><li>WordCamps are city-based conferences that take place in cities worldwide. These events usually last 1-3 days and are organized and run by volunteers.</li><li>The talks are also recorded and made available on the free, online library <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>. These can be watched from the comfort of your own home, office or during informal get-togethers.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>What can we do as part of the WordPress community?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital citizenship skills, like many other skills needed in this tech-focused world, should be kept up-to-date. Open source communities offer unparalleled opportunities to do this and are available in countries across the world. As part of our role as members of WordPress and other communities, we can pass on such skills to others. For instance by working alongside people who have had limited experience of digital skills. Or by finding new ways of making this knowledge sharing fun and accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here are just a few of the ways we do and can make an even greater difference:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>as bloggers and writers, we can be more aware of how to write content responsibly.</li><li>as designers, we can think more about how different people will view, understand and respond to the designs and visuals we create or use.</li><li>as developers, we can build systems that make it easier for all users to find information and accomplish their goals, to be secure while visiting our sites, and to model good security and practice.</li><li>as community members, through organizing events like <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pro/wordpress\">WordPress Meetups</a> and <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org\">WordCamps</a>, we are helping equip those who may not have had access to digital literacy or who lack the confidence to put it into place or share with their family and colleagues. Through these events, the online videos and other resources on <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/\">WordPress.tv</a> and through the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress teams</a>, we are already making a difference every day.</li><li>as individuals, the way we communicate in the community and listen to each other is equally important. This is a vital part of how we grow and model positive digital citizens. Through growing our positive digital skills and a better understanding of online etiquette and challenges, we can make our immediate and wider digital world a more positive and useful environment.</li><li>making it easier to document and share knowledge.</li><li>emphasizing how skills learned within the community can be used in other parts of our digital lives.</li><li>creating and becoming ambassadors for Digital Citizenship.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also get involved with specific events that have grown out of the wider WordPress project, championed by enthusiasts and those wanting to improve specific digital skills and bring wider benefits to society.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Community-driven Events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org\"><strong>WordPress Translation Day</strong></a> in 2019 had 81 local events worldwide. Running for 24-hours, individuals with language skills translated aspects of the platform into multiple languages with a total of 1181 projects modified. An amazing 221 new translators joined on the day. In addition, there was a live stream with talks, panel discussions, interviews, and sharing of tips and skills to help others learn how to translate. Volunteers are now planning the event for 2020!<br /><br /><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2019/03/01/global-wordpress-translation-day-4-is-coming/\">Stories of how people came together for WordPress Translation Day</a></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div><br />Interviews with some of the participants from a previous WordPress Translation Day giving a flavour of how volunteers developed this event.\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do_action days</strong> are WordPress events organized in local communities to help give charities their own online presence. Each event involves members of the local WordPress community, planning and building new websites for selected local organizations in one day. Some take place in a working day, others on weekends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>Volunteer Tess Coughlan-Allen talking about how people came together for the first do_action in Europe to help local charities. \n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://doaction.org\">Find the next do_action hackaton nearby your home town.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Improving digital skills through WordPress</h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div><br />In this video clip, Josepha talks about the Digital Divide and what current technological trends mean for it in the future.

Nick Gernert, head of WordPress.com VIP, has since <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-has-discontinued-active-development-on-edit-flow-plugin#comment-307821\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on our post to clarify the company&#8217;s intentions. He said Automattic is &#8220;in no way dropping support for Edit Flow:&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ll start by saying we are in no way dropping support for Edit Flow.</p>\n<p>We do see a difference between active feature development and maintenance updates to a plugin and this post tends to use these things interchangeably. It is correct that we are not currently pushing new features for Edit Flow. However, we are committed to maintaining this and other plugins so that those who depend on them are able to continue to do so.</p>\n<p>We face the same challenge that many in software face when it comes to supporting existing work while looking to the future and where to invest energy. I hope folks can understand the delicate balance here. We accept that we have fallen short at times when it comes to maintaining our existing work and appreciate the community holding us accountable.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gernert also said the company&#8217;s VIP service is &#8220;seeing demand for WordPress in the enterprise market like never before.&#8221; The team is doubling down on its commitment to product development for this market and Gernert said outlook for Edit Flow and other Automattic plugins should improve:</p>\n<blockquote><p>VIP is more committed than ever to product development for the unique needs of this space. We have recently brought on a new Head of Product and Engineering. With the addition of this role, there is a commitment to focused product development and that includes ensuring key plugins like Edit Flow are maintained. Presently, that maintenance includes security updates, critical bugs, ensuring compatibility with new versions of WordPress, and directly supporting VIP customer use. Going forward the VIP Product and Engineering teams are committed to allocating time to regularly review and address issues and provide regular updates to the plugins. As we stabilize on maintenance, new feature development will pick up in areas where we see unique opportunity.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Users and developers seemed wary of this response, given the plugin&#8217;s history and more recent experiences of trying to contribute to its upkeep. <a href=\"https://gorillabunny.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">James Miller</a>, a developer who was using Edit Flow on a client project, shared his experience trying to submit a PR for a bug fix.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It doesn’t seem like it’s even being given a level of attention at the most basic level of what could be considered &#8216;maintained,\'&#8221; Miller said. &#8220;This plugin was breaking functionality of other plugins on a client site.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I forked the repo, fixed the issue, and <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/Edit-Flow/pull/499\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">submitted a PR</a> on January 26. After several months of periodic commenting and asking if anybody was even maintaining the repo, it finally got merged just last month. This doesn’t seem to me like a commitment to maintaining the plugin.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What Does this Mean for Edit Flow Users?</h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not currently experiencing any critical bugs and you don&#8217;t require additional features beyond what it offers, Edit Flow may be still be a good option if Automattic is able to improve its maintenance. As previously predicted, any new features coming to this plugin will be those that &#8220;directly support VIP customer use.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Support for the plugin has not improved over the last week, so users may still be waiting for updates and fixes for awhile. The support forums indicate that multiple users continue to report issues with both the block editor and the classic editor, as well as conflicts with other plugins. This is likely why Automattic support representatives <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/edit-flow-plugin-is-closed-no-longer-supported/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">recommend</a> users fork Edit Flow or switch to another solution.</p>\n<p>In support of smaller WordPress-powered publications that have an immediate need for editorial tools, we have compiled a list of alternatives that offer more frequent maintenance and support. Edit Flow&#8217;s primary features include a calendar, custom statuses, editorial comments, editorial metadata, notifications, story budget, and user groups. One of the alternatives below may be a suitable replacement, depending on which features are most important to your editorial workflow.</p>\n<h3>PublishPress</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/publishpress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PublishPress</a> is the plugin that Automattic recommended as an alternative, and it is the closest one to matching Edit Flow&#8217;s features. It has 7,000 active installs and is used by companies, non-profits, educational institutions, magazines, newspapers, and blogs.</p>\n<p>In the free plugin, PublishPress provides an editorial calendar, notifications, editorial comments, custom statuses, content overview, and the ability to create custom metadata for posts. Its creators also offer commercial add-ons for things like a content checklist, Slack notifications, multiple authors, WooCommerce checklist, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/publishpress-editorial-calendar.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Since PublishPress is actually a fork of the Edit Flow plugin, users can <a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/migrate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">migrate seamlessly from Edit Flow</a> without losing any data or settings using the plugin&#8217;s built-in migration utility.</p>\n<p>The PublishPress team has also created several other publishing plugins that may also be useful for different editorial needs, including <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/revisionary/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PublishPress Revisions</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-permit-core/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PressPermit</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/capability-manager-enhanced/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Capability Manager Enhanced</a>.</p>\n<h3>Oasis Workflow</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/oasis-workflow/\">Oasis Workflow</a> is a plugin that allows site admins to create custom workflows for content review. It includes three process/task templates for assignment, review, and publishing actions with role-based routing. Workflows can be configured using a drag-and-drop interface. The plugin supports custom statuses, process history, task reassignment, due dates, and email reminders.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/oasis-workflow.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Oasis Workflow is often used in healthcare, law and financial firms, universities, CPA firms, non-profits, news outlets, and other organizations that require a formal review process for publishing. A <a href=\"https://www.oasisworkflow.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commercial version</a> of the plugin includes features like multiple workflows, auto submit, revisions for published content, with add-ons for editorial contextual comments, teams, groups, and more.</p>\n<h3>Nelio Content</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nelio-content/\">Nelio Content</a> is a plugin with 6,000 active installs that includes an editorial calendar, editorial comments, tasks, and a content assistant. It also helps users schedule and automatically promote content on social networks. The plugin integrates relevant metrics from Google Analytics and social media accounts to assist users in promoting content.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/nelio-calendar.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>Editorial Calendar</h3>\n<p>If the editorial calendar feature of Edit Flow is the only one you need, then the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorial-calendar/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Editorial Calendar</a> plugin might be a good alternative. It is used on more than 40,000 WordPress sites. The plugin provides an overview of when each post will be published, supports multiple authors, the ability to rearrange the schedule with drag-and-drop capabilities, and edit posts directly in the calendar.</p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\"></div>\n<h3>WP Scheduled Posts</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-scheduled-posts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WP Scheduled Posts</a> is another editorial calendar plugin that makes it easy to manage multiple authors from one place. It includes a visual calendar that can be manipulated via drag-and-drop, allowing users to easily add posts in the queue or create new posts inside the calendar. The plugin has a dashboard widget that displays post statuses for single or multiple authors.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/schedule-calendar.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wpdeveloper.net/plugins/wp-scheduled-posts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">commercial version</a> of WP Scheduled Posts is targeted at the scheduling aspects of publishing. It offers an auto-scheduler where users can create rules to publish content automatically, as well as a missed schedule handler for automatically publishing posts that didn&#8217;t go out on schedule.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 21:21:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Meta Box Settings Page Extension Adds Support for Customizer, Network-Wide Settings\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94811\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"https://wptavern.com/meta-box-settings-page-extension-adds-support-for-customizer-network-wide-settings\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3677:\"<p>The team behind the Meta Box plugin <a href=\"https://metabox.io/mb-settings-page-customizer-multisite\">updated their MB Settings Page add-on</a> to include support for the customizer and multisite.  The customizer feature allows theme authors to integrate their custom settings into the customizer using framework-specific code.  The multisite integration allows plugin authors to create a network settings page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new features come on the heels of an <a href=\"https://metabox.io/meta-box-updates-better-performance-for-object-fields-mb-core-and-new-settings-page\">update to the core Meta Box plugin</a> that improves performance for users who have thousands of objects such as posts, terms, or users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/meta-box/\">Meta Box</a> plugin originated as a custom fields framework for plugin and theme authors to create meta boxes.  It has since grown to handle settings across taxonomies, user profiles, options pages, comment forms, and other areas that have form fields.  The plugin offers a unifying API for developers to code over 40 field types without the need to learn each of the internal, field-related APIs in WordPress.  At the moment, the plugin has over 400,000 active installations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Framework-style plugins such as Meta Box, Advanced Custom Fields, and others have filled a gap left open by core WordPress, which does not have a single API for handling fields.  Over the years, developers have been left to code against dissimilar APIs and in different languages (PHP and JavaScript).  This new feature from the Meta Box team will further extend its usefulness to a large number of developers who need to build out options for their users quickly and without learning additional APIs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://metabox.io/plugins/mb-settings-page/\">MB Settings Page add-on</a> is a premium extension that allows theme and plugin authors to create custom settings pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The purpose of its customizer integration is for theme authors to map settings pages to customizer panels.  However, the feature also allows for sections instead.  All of the Meta Box&#8217;s field types carry over to the customizer except for its file and image field types due to limitations with how the customizer works.  However, other file and image-related fields will handle most needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customizer integration isn&#8217;t an all-or-nothing thing.  Developers can choose to keep both a custom settings page and panels in the customizer.  They may also opt for one screen over the other based on their needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Meta Box team released a video showcasing the new customizer support with some mood music.  <em>To be honest, I&#8217;m just chilling out and listening as I write this article.  I&#8217;ve got a little head bob going too.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>There is currently no word on whether the customizer fields support live preview.  Based on the video, when a user updates an option, the preview panel performs a full page refresh.  If live preview is not currently a feature, it would be a welcome one in a future update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Along with customizer integration, the MB Settings Page update provides the ability for developers to create network-wide settings for multisite.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some developers, network-wide settings are a bit of an afterthought or something they don&#8217;t consider at all for their plugins.  Not all plugins need options on the network level.  For those that do, authors can start using their custom Meta Box fields directly in the WordPress network admin with a single line of code.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Oct 2019 17:58:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.3 Improves Large Image Handling\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94814\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-3-improves-large-image-handling\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2222:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/wordpress-5-3-beta-3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WordPress 5.3 Beta 3</a> was released this week and RC 1 is right around the corner, expected <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-3/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">October 15</a>. Core contributors have been publishing developer notes on new features landing in this release. One exciting enhancement that hasn&#8217;t received much attention yet is WordPress&#8217; updated <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47873\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">handling of large images</a>.</p>\n<p>Many WordPress users don&#8217;t consider the size of the images they are uploading to their sites, and modern smartphones are capable of producing very high quality images at very large file sizes. WordPress 5.3 will automatically detect large images (with a default threshold of 2560px) and generate a “web-optimized maximum size.&#8221; The threshold is used as the max-height and max-width value to scale down the image for use as the largest available size. A new <code>big_image_size_threshold</code> filter is available for developers who want to change the threshold size or disable the new feature altogether.</p>\n<p>WordPress will store the original image size so that it is still accessible and a new function is available for fetching its path: <code>wp_get_original_image_path()</code>. It is also used to generate all the image sub-sizes.</p>\n<p>More than two million WordPress users rely on plugins like Imsanity, Smushit, and EWWW Image Optimizer to optimize images. They often include additional features for bulk resizing previously uploaded images. WordPress&#8217; new large image handling <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/10/09/introducing-handling-of-big-images-in-wordpress-5-3/#comment-37044\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">should not interfere with image optimization plugins</a>, because it doesn&#8217;t affect the default settings that they often hook into and use to perform additional optimizations. The new core enhancement may be suitable to replace these plugins for some users who only require the bare minimum optimization on upload.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 19:46:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: MachoThemes, Modula Parent Company, Acquires Three Gallery Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94816\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/machothemes-modula-parent-company-acquires-three-gallery-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3453:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.machothemes.com\">MachoThemes</a>, the WordPress development company behind the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/modula-best-grid-gallery/\">Modula Gallery</a> plugin, has acquired three gallery plugins.  The company is currently rolling the first two of the plugins, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/final-tiles-grid-gallery-lite/\">Final Tiles Grid Gallery Lite</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/photoblocks-grid-gallery/\">PhotoBlocks Grid Gallery</a>, into Modula.  The third plugin, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/everlightbox/\">EverLightbox</a>, will remain as a standalone project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three plugins were purchased from Diego Imbriani of GreenTreeLabs.  This was not MachoThemes&#8217; first acquisition from Imbriani.  They acquired the original Modula plugin from him over two years ago.  From there, they grew the user base and continued developing the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this time, the exact details of the financial terms are not available to the public, but the transaction was in the range of low-to-mid 5-figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The acquisition is a part of MachoThemes&#8217; growth strategy for building a larger audience for their Modula plugin, which currently has over 60,000 active installations.  &#8220;We liked their feature set, their quirkiness, and overall what they stand for,&#8221; said MachoThemes owner Christian Raiber of the reasons behind the acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The merge of Final Tiles and PhotoBlocks affects over 34,000 plugin users.  MachoThemes does not plan to continue supporting or developing them as individual plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team is in the process of building a migration script to allow users to bring their existing galleries over to the Modula plugin.  It is important that users migrate to Modula or another option because unsupported versions of their current plugins may not work in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both plugins are similar to Modula by allowing users to create a gallery separately from the primary post content screen.  However, the user interface and experience between all three plugins are nothing alike.  Merging the plugins into Modula means that MachoThemes can work on a single interface and experience for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users may be worried about losing features when migrating to a new plugin.  &#8220;Most of these options already exist in Modula, under a different name, setting or otherwise paid extension,&#8221; said Raiber.  &#8220;There are a few interesting options in these plugins indeed, and they&#8217;ve already sparked new ideas for the team to experiment with.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Raiber said his company would reach out to users.  &#8220;We&#8217;ll have videos, doc entries, and a dedicated page on wp-modula.com,&#8221; he said of the transition.  The company plans to keep the plugins available for the next six months but may extend that period depending on how the transition for users is going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The EverLightbox plugin will remain separate for those who want a lightbox feature for the standard WordPress galleries but not a full gallery-editing plugin.  &#8220;We will continue to support the plugin and work hard to ensure that all users have a smooth-sailing experience with the plugin just as we have been for all of the plugins we&#8217;ve been building,&#8221; said Raiber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company plans to continue developing and supporting EverLightbox for the long term.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Oct 2019 19:21:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: ExpressionEngine Under New Ownership, Will Remain Open Source for Now\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94761\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"https://wptavern.com/expressionengine-under-new-ownership-will-remain-open-source-for-now\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7521:\"<p>EllisLab founder Rick Ellis <a href=\"https://expressionengine.com/blog/expressionengine-has-a-new-owner\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">announced</a> yesterday that ExpressionEngine has been acquired by Packet Tide, the parent company of <a href=\"https://eeharbor.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EEHarbor</a>, one of the most successful EE add-on providers and development agencies in the community.

EE&#8217;s dwindling community of product developers and site builders were hopeful that the new open source licensing would expand EE&#8217;s reach and bring back developers who had migrated to alternatives like <a href=\"https://craftcms.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Craft</a>.</p>\n<p>After the acquisition announcement, the EE community was concerned whether or not it will remain free and open source. Although the software&#8217;s homepage sports the tagline &#8220;The Open-Source CMS that supports YOU all the way,&#8221; EE&#8217;s new owners have left the option open for reconsidering its licensing further down the road. They plan to stick with the open source license for the time being. When asked directly in the <a href=\"https://t.co/gjVhmpqqn1?amp=1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">EE Slack</a>, EE Harbor developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TomJaeger\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Jaeger</a> said, &#8220;That is our plan for now, although at this stage we&#8217;re looking at everything with a fresh eye towards what&#8217;s best.&#8221; The company has <a href=\"https://eeharbor.com/faq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">published a list of FAQs</a> with the same information.</p>\n<p>Brian Litzinger, a developer at <a href=\"https://boldminded.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">BoldMinded</a>, who has created more than 36 add-ons for EE, and is also on the EECA (ExpressionEngine Community Association) board that organizes EEConf, said he has confirmed that EEHarbor plans to keep the CMS open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The board spoke to new ownership just today actually, and they have every intention of keeping it open source,&#8221; Litzinger said. &#8220;I can’t speak for the whole community, but since going open source my add-on sales have not significantly increased or decreased.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As with any open source project there has been feedback and pull requests from the community, but nothing significant (e.g. large features). The community as a whole is pretty excited about the new ownership and ExpressionEngine&#8217;s future though.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Shawn Maida, founder of <a href=\"https://fostermade.co\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Foster Made</a>, a company that also sells ExpressionEngine add-ons, said he has not seen a significant direct change in the economics of EE since the project went open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the real question here is what business model best enables the growth and continued support of the CMS itself, and how is that balanced against the growth of the community,&#8221; Maida said. &#8220;As a business that offers some add-ons for ExpressionEngine, we need to see both continued growth in ExpressionEngine as a platform and growth in the community, so I think the license model that best enables that matters.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Travis Smith, president of <a href=\"https://www.hopstudios.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hop Studios</a>, has been working with EE since its early days. As someone who is deeply invested in the EE community, he said that he doesn&#8217;t think a prospective licensing change would impact the broader community as much as having a clear vision for the CMS&#8217;s future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think a licensing change per se wouldn&#8217;t be good or bad, but a well-articulated and communicated vision for the CMS&#8217;s future would be really helpful for a community that feels unsure at the moment,&#8221; Smith said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I do think that the exposure that going open source gave into the development process overall at EllisLab was an improvement, and that new features and bug fixes were getting added at a decent pace.&#8221;</p>\n<p>EE may have changed its licensing to be open source but it is not a community-led project where major decisions happen by a consensus of a diverse representation of community leadership.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t observe the community gaining (or applying?) much input or influence over the future of ExpressionEngine in the past year,&#8221; Smith said. &#8220;I think there was still a feeling of &#8216;EE is EllisLab&#8217;s project&#8217; &#8212; and that this change of ownership might shake the community&#8217;s devs out of that default assumption, which would be a good thing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the <a href=\"https://eeharbor.com/faq\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">FAQs EEHarbor published today</a>, the company confirmed that it will be developing new features and that it will consider feedback submitted from the community:</p>\n<blockquote><p>While we are in the early stages of long-term strategic planning, we already have a lot of thoughts and ideas around where to take ExpressionEngine based on our own experience. However, it’s not just about us. We are also very interested in collaborating with the ExpressionEngine community. Everyone is more than welcome to submit feedback for us to review as we consider the future of ExpressionEngine</p></blockquote>\n<p>After 16 years under a restrictive license, EE is an interesting example of a newly open source, corporate-led project with a community that is rediscovering its place while ownership of the software is transferred from one company to another. Responses to the acquisition are mostly positive, and users seem excited about Packet Tide&#8217;s first planned initiative &#8211; finishing development on ExpressionEngine 6.0. Ellis described this upcoming release as &#8220;an exciting new version we’ve been quietly working on behind the scenes.&#8221; It will include a new control panel with a dark theme, along with add-on and service integrations inside the app.</p>\n<p>EEHarbor does not plan to merge its add-ons with ExpressionEngine core at this time, and the statement published today reiterates the company&#8217;s commitment to &#8220;keep the add-on marketplace fair and open to all developers.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Oct 2019 23:11:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"WPTavern: Rosa 2 Restaurant Theme Provides a Frustrating and Satisfying Experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94769\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"https://wptavern.com/rosa-2-restaurant-theme-provides-a-frustrating-and-satisfying-experience\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9220:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pixelgrade.com/themes/restaurants/rosa2/\">Rosa 2</a> is the sequel to Pixelgrade&#8217;s best-selling theme, Rosa.  The new theme re-imagines its previous incarnation in the context of the block editor (Gutenberg).   I was provided a copy of the theme for free to test and provide my thoughts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme sells for $75/year, or you can pay a one-time fee of $95 for lifetime access.  The <a href=\"https://pixelgrade.com/blog/product/meet-rosa-2/\">product launch post</a> could make anyone excited about this theme, but is it worth it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>TLDR;</strong> Rosa 2 made for a satisfying experience when building restaurant-style pages.  However, the early learning curve and basic setup were frustrating.  It also lacks some of the polish I&#8217;d expect at a premium price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Rundown of the Issues</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I dive into the good things about Rosa 2 (and there are some nice things about this theme), let me dive into the frustrating aspects.  There were so many pain points that I nearly gave up on the theme several times.  However, I soldiered on in the hopes of understanding why this theme might be worth using.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Install the Required Plugins First</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let me save you some time right now.  When the theme says that it requires the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/customify/\">Customify</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/nova-blocks/\">Nova Blocks</a> plugins, it truly requires them.  Otherwise, the theme looks and behaves nothing like the demo or screenshots.  It may as well not be the same theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When first activating the theme, the front page of your website will become a completely white screen.  It is not the dreaded <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/common-wordpress-errors/#the-white-screen-of-death\">White Screen of Death</a> caused by an error.  Instead, the theme is forcibly hiding the content with custom styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Why?</em>  Yeah, good question.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see no reason to do so.  Outside of changing some code (which I did), users must activate the plugins to make their content appear.  There is no technical reason this should be the case when using this theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There should be no path in which a user installs a theme only to have their content disappear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get it.  I was told these were required plugins.  The theme even provides easy installation and activation links via the TGM Plugin Activation script.  I also get that WordPress lacks any sort of real dependency system for handling this feature.  That doesn&#8217;t make it any less of a poor user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a developer, I thought I&#8217;d trick the system and test the theme without those plugins installed.  I wanted to see what the theme looked like out of the box, which you can see in the following screenshot.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, and that big block of category links in the above screenshot, it never goes away.  It just sits there on your blog posts page.  It is hard-coded in the posts page template (<code>home.php</code>).  Rosa 2 is billed as a restaurant theme, so it might be acceptable if you don&#8217;t plan on running a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Header and Nav Problems</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The default header looks nothing like the screenshots, demo, or video for the theme.  After nearly two hours of using the theme, I was ready to throw in the towel and rule this theme out as a lost cause.  Not being able to get the basic nav menu set up for the theme was an exercise in self-punishment that I wouldn&#8217;t wish on anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It turns out that the Nova Blocks plugin really is required.  <em>Did I mention that you should install the required plugins first?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Stretched images</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On blog and archive pages, expect stretched featured images that attempt to fill out the box next to the excerpt for existing posts.  There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any remedy to this outside of uploading new images.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme uses the standard <code>post-thumbnail</code> size but does not define this size in the code.  For those unfamiliar with the technical aspects when using this specific size, the theme should ideally define it via the <code>set_post_thumbnail_size()</code> function.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Sticky header</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The large sticky header gave me a gut-wrenching feeling that walls were closing in on me.  I became light-headed and dizzy.  I found it tough to breathe.  This is not hyperbole.  I&#8217;m dead serious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On a personal note, I&#8217;ve had some issues with claustrophobia for the last couple of years.  I first had this feeling after being stuck indoors for two weeks while watching over one of my cats who had surgery.  I typically work from the porch where I can get fresh air, but that was one of the worst periods of my life.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since then, I often get this same feeling when sites have large sticky headers.  It feels like the walls are closing down.  <em>I wonder if others have similar issues.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This feeling could be alleviated if the theme minimized the sticky-header height while scrolling down the page.  Fortunately, the theme allows users to choose a static header, which I strongly suggest using.  There are some other spacing and sizing options for the header area, which can help shrink some of this down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Where the Theme Shines</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/rosa2-custom-page.jpg?ssl=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img /></a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If there is one thing this theme does well, it is making it simple to create pages for a restaurant via the Nova Blocks plugin.  Within minutes of creating a custom page, I had a restaurant-style page set up and ready to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When coupled with Nova Blocks, the theme beautifully handles the process of creating custom pages with numerous unique outcomes.  The integration with the plugin is brilliant.  Each block has custom demo content that you can easily modify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the names of the blocks and block options were cutesy and fun, such as &#8220;Hero of the Galaxy,&#8221; but they became a slight nuisance when wanting to quickly figure out the purpose of a block.  I could see some users becoming annoyed at the names, and they might not be ideal for some professional settings.  They were kind of fun though.  I have mixed feelings about them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Does the Theme Handle Gutenberg?</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosa 2 is a theme primarily built for the block editor.  It wonderfully handled core block output in my tests.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When using Gutenberg-ready themes, I view the pullquote block as sort of the theme designer&#8217;s signature. It is one of those blocks where designers can have a lot of fun and put a unique spin on the display.  I&#8217;m a fan of the pullquote style in this theme (pictured above).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, it works well.  When coupled with Nova Blocks, you have a lot of power at your disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Does the Code Stack Up?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rosa 2 is lightweight in terms of custom code.  Nearly all of the functionality is within the accompanying plugins.  Because this is a theme review, I didn&#8217;t dive into the plugin code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a purely technical standpoint, the theme does most things according to standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some things I&#8217;d change from an architectural standpoint.  For example, the file for its Customify plugin integration is over 1,100 lines of code.  I would break that down to more digestible bits, which would help with long-term maintenance and bug hunting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the editor-related JavaScript code could be more efficient.  Repeated patterns should be grouped together to make the code smaller.  The editor JavaScript file is not large, but every byte counts in a world where developers assume everyone is running on Gigabit internet connections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary stylesheet is 173 kb, which is <em>OMGBBQ</em> large, especially when you top it off with 100s of kb coming from the stylesheets and scripts loaded by Nova Blocks plugin.  Unless you&#8217;re a user who is heavily optimizing your site, you can count on some slow page loads.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Final Verdict</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d only recommend this theme to people who have more patience than me.  While I didn&#8217;t follow instructions right off the bat (as a reviewer, I&#8217;m trying to push limits and break things), the theme did have some pain points that simply made for a frustrating process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m in the camp of people who believes themes should work out of the box.  This theme doesn&#8217;t work without some setup.  You&#8217;ll need to put in some legwork to get it going.  However, once you make it over the initial hump, you can build some beautiful page layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suggest using it strictly for its defined purpose of building a restaurant website.  The typography is designed well enough for blogging, but the overall theme isn&#8217;t well-suited to it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Oct 2019 19:47:11 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.3 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=7312\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/wordpress-5-3-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3723:\"<p>WordPress 5.3 Beta 3 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

The Internet Age was upon us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was born and raised in a small community in rural Alabama.  The country.  The backwoods.  To give you an idea of how small the place was, my entire school (grades K-12) had around 800 students.  While I was fortunate enough that my family could afford to travel for vacation almost every year, I mostly lived a sheltered life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rode bikes down the dirt road and explored neighbors&#8217; hunting lands with my best friend in the summer.  We&#8217;d get up at dawn, grab some provisions, and cycle out for the day&#8217;s adventure.  We&#8217;d race old lawnmowers, build unstable treehouses, and swim in what were likely snake-infested creeks.  We&#8217;d camp out under the stars.  Our parents never asked where we were.  As long as we showed up for supper and took a bath a few times each week to scrub the dirt off, we were generally left up to our own imaginations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was another aspect of growing up in the &#8217;90s, and that was video games.  At 16, I spent most of the summer in the fields picking watermelons or throwing bales of hay onto a trailer.  It was hard work, but it kept me supplied with whatever video games I wanted.  When not out in the wild, my best friend and I would be glued to a 19-inch television playing the Nintendo 64 (and later the Sega Dreamcast).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I lived in this somewhat country-bumpkin bubble with no idea of the outside world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then came the explosion of the internet.  My family never had a computer at home.  That left me to access this wonderful new thing during school hours or at a friend&#8217;s house.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like pretty much every teen boy I knew at the time, the best use of the internet was logging into adult chatrooms and hoping to chat with a woman.  Yeah, the average teenage boy wasn&#8217;t doing anything productive with the internet, even in the &#8217;90s.  Big surprise there.  This isn&#8217;t groundbreaking news, folks.  Move along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were other uses of chatrooms, such as finding other gamers.  That&#8217;s where my original love of the internet began.  I could talk to people across the world about Nintendo and Sega games.  I even started getting pen-pals where we would exchange weekly emails.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, there was this common saying among adults, &#8220;You don&#8217;t know who you&#8217;re talking to on that thing. It could be a fat, 40-year-old man living in his parents&#8217; basement.&#8221;  <em>Hey, why you throwin&#8217; shade at heavyset men?  Just tell me it could be a psycho.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents drilled this lesson into my brain.  School teachers did the same.  Like my peers at the time, I was required to use a pseudonym when going online.  The thought of using a real name was almost unheard of.  As teens, we&#8217;d joke about the basement-dwelling bogeyman who our parents and teachers warned us against.  It was all a game to us despite there being legitimate fears, particularly now that I have 20 years of hindsight at my disposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s where I came up with my username of <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady\">greenshady</a>, by the way.  One day I may even tell what it means.  One day.  For now, I&#8217;ll keep all of you who have asked about it over the years guessing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I used that username for years because there was always this little voice in the back of my mind telling me to remain anonymous.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Anonymity in the Age of Transparency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not exactly sure at what point attitudes toward anonymity changed.  Social networks likely played a huge role transitioning us from silly screen names to using our real-life names on the internet.  Otherwise, it&#8217;d be harder for our real-life friends to find us on Facebook, Twitter, and elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This prevailing attitude toward anonymity didn&#8217;t limit itself to social networks.  More and more, people shunned the idea of anonymous posts or comments on blogs and elsewhere.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s likely some form of stardom attached to using real names as well.  Everyone is just one video, one blog post, or one tweetstorm away from their 15 minutes in the spotlight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even within the WordPress community over the years, I&#8217;ve witnessed a shift toward automatically disliking anonymous comments.  The prevailing idea is that a person&#8217;s contribution to a discussion has less worth if it&#8217;s hidden behind the veil of anonymity, that one&#8217;s opinions are invalid if they cannot be backed up by a real name. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It opens the person to attack not based on their ideas but on how they choose to present themselves online.  This is a part of the culture that is unhealthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a time when you can effectively be shut out from the modern-day public square for making one wrong statement, anonymity is more important than ever for some.  Often, there&#8217;s no recourse for missteps after you&#8217;ve been taken down by the angry horde over a lapse in judgment.  Once your name has been hauled through the mud and back again, there&#8217;s little you can do about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That little voice in the back of my mind, the one carefully crafted by my parents and teachers, is a reminder that a simpler period during the Internet Age once existed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are other pockets of the internet where the pseudonym has persisted.  One area is in gaming.  You&#8217;d be the oddball if using a real name in an online multiplayer match.  <em>I suppose &#8220;Brett&#8221; or &#8220;Molly&#8221; doesn&#8217;t strike fear in the heart&#8217;s of enemies.</em>  The entire culture of online gaming is built upon anonymity, which is at odds with much of the internet world today.  Frankly, I find it oddly satisfying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do wonder whether a real name online is important for civil discourse.  Quite often, online personas are much different than their real-life counterparts.  I mean, have you seen the numerous alpha-male groups on social networks made up of men who all think they&#8217;re the leaders of the pack?  <em>Hmmm…maybe there was some truth to that basement-dweller theory, after all.  Thanks for the heads up, Mom and Dad.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The point is that an online persona, even attached to a real name, is still a persona.  It&#8217;s not much different than a fake user handle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d wager that the need to see a person&#8217;s real name has more to do with knowing exactly who to shun for controversial ideas rather than attaching some sort of validity to it.  Usernames can be altered.  You&#8217;re pretty much stuck with your real name, and mishaps follow your real name around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As we were reviewing the Tavern&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/comment-policy\">comment policy</a> last week, one point I brought up is that I believe we should allow anonymous comments.  A large reason for this is that people should feel safe to communicate their thoughts within the community.  While I won&#8217;t get into the specifics of internal discussions, I do hope that it&#8217;s something we officially remove from the policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being in favor of anonymity does not mean being in favor of personal attacks or handing over a license to use a vulgar term as a username.  It&#8217;s about protecting people&#8217;s ability to speak freely without fear of becoming an outcast within the community for an unpopular opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes anonymity provides people the freedom they need to effectively discuss ideas.  More importantly, it allows them to be a part of the community in a way that they choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are We Moving back?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the European Union, Japan, Australia, and other countries passing stricter privacy laws, there&#8217;s a growing movement to protect privacy across the world.  While this movement has focused more on large corporations and what they do with personal data, there&#8217;s an underlying fear that&#8217;s likely been there from the beginning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>People are coming to the realization that we gave up too much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We handed over our names.  And, once we handed over our names, it was a slippery slope to handing over everything else about ourselves.  If you dig deep enough you can find the names of all my cats and when they were all born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not sure how I feel about that.  I&#8217;m in too deep at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My parents from 20 years ago would not have liked the idea too much.  My dad just uses YouTube to watch videos on building stuff for the most part today (it took years to stop him sending me email chains), but my stepmom is right there along with everyone else on social networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s odd to look back on the past 20 years to see how some of our initial fears surrounding anonymity have transformed.  In another 20 years, we&#8217;ll all be back to using pseudonyms again.  Call me out on it if I&#8217;m wrong.  I do wonder if we&#8217;ll look back at this time and think everyone was crazy for using their real names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I welcome your anonymous comments on this post.  Just don&#8217;t use &#8220;wanker&#8221; for your handle.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Oct 2019 19:20:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"WPTavern: GNU Project Maintainers Move to Oust Richard Stallman from Leadership\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94714\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:90:\"https://wptavern.com/gnu-project-maintainers-move-to-oust-richard-stallman-from-leadership\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5486:\"<p>GNU Project maintainers are working to oust Richard Stallman from his position as head of the organization. In a joint <a href=\"https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2019/joint-statement-on-the-gnu-project/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> published yesterday morning, a collection of 22 GNU maintainers and developers thanked Stallman for his work and declared that he can no longer represent the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We, the undersigned GNU maintainers and developers, owe a debt of gratitude to Richard Stallman for his decades of important work in the free software movement. Stallman tirelessly emphasized the importance of computer user freedom and laid the foundation for his vision to become a reality by starting the development of the GNU operating system. For that we are truly grateful.</p>\n<p>Yet, we must also acknowledge that Stallman’s behavior over the years has undermined a core value of the GNU project: the empowerment of all computer users. GNU is not fulfilling its mission when the behavior of its leader alienates a large part of those we want to reach out to.</p>\n<p>We believe that Richard Stallman cannot represent all of GNU.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.stallman.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stallman&#8217;s personal website</a> continues to prominently display his intentions to remain in the leadership role. He added the header to his site, following the publication of remarks he made regarding a 17-year old victim of sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, which precipitated his <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gpl-author-richard-stallman-resigns-from-free-software-foundation\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">resignation from both MIT and the Free Software Foundation</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Screen-Shot-2019-10-07-at-9.44.17-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Stallman saga has continued to grow stranger in the aftermath of his resignations, as many were concerned that he would be homeless after his website featured a notice that he was &#8220;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190929052858/https://stallman.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Seeking Housing</a>,&#8221; accompanied by a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190929045948/https://stallman.org/seeking-housing.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">link</a> leading to his specific requirements for a temporary residence. His personal site was also reportedly <a href=\"http://techrights.org/2019/09/29/fsf-defaced-rms/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">vandalized</a> nine days ago with a message that he was stepping down from the GNU.</p>\n<p>The defacement with the false GNU resignation message was reverted shortly thereafter on September 30, and replaced with the header saying he continues to be &#8220;Chief GNUisance of the GNU Project&#8221; with no intention of stopping soon. Stallman has not yet publicly acknowledged the statement from the GNU maintainers. He has also not yet responded to our request for comment.</p>\n<p>Yesterday the Free Software Foundation (FSF) published a <a href=\"https://www.fsf.org/news/fsf-and-gnu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> indicating it was re-evaluating its working relationship with the GNU project, which has provided some of its technical infrastructure, fiscal sponsorship, and copyright assignment:</p>\n<blockquote><p>GNU decision-making has largely been in the hands of GNU leadership. Since RMS resigned as president of the FSF, but not as head of GNU (&#8220;Chief GNUisance&#8221;), the FSF is now working with GNU leadership on a shared understanding of the relationship for the future. As part of that, we invite comments from free software community members.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Stallman responded the next day, indicating he wanted to work with FSF on restructuring the relationship between the two organizations:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I recently resigned as president of the FSF, but the FSF continues to provide several forms of crucial support for the GNU Project.  As head of the GNU Project, I will be working with the FSF on how to structure<br />\nthe GNU Project&#8217;s relationship with the FSF in the future.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The FSF maintains some critical responsibilities in that it currently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Software_Foundation#History\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">holds the copyrights to enforce the GPL</a>. Stallman has recently called on people to <a href=\"http://techrights.org/2019/10/01/what-stallman-wants/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">continue supporting the FSF&#8217;s work</a>, despite his resignation from the organization.</p>\n<p>The small contingency of GNU project maintainers who penned the <a href=\"https://guix.gnu.org/blog/2019/joint-statement-on-the-gnu-project/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a> published yesterday seem to be on the same page with FSF in its rejection of Stallman&#8217;s leadership. Their message concludes with their intention to overhaul the leadership of the free software movement to be more inclusive of the people who have been alienated by Stallman&#8217;s behavior over the years:</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think it is now time for GNU maintainers to collectively decide about the organization of the project.

The earlier U.S. 9th Circuit court <a href=\"http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2019/01/15/17-55504.pdf\">ruled that websites fall under</a> Title III of the American with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The original case was brought forth by Guillermo Robles, a blind man, who claimed the Domino&#8217;s website and app did not allow him to place an order in 2016.  Robles, like many other people with disabilities, relies on screen-reader software to use the web.  Despite using such software, he was not able to make an order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary issue of the case was whether the ADA applied to websites or apps in the same way that they applied to brick-and-mortar locations.  Title III specifically points out public places of accommodation but not websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The specific <a href=\"https://www.ada.gov/regs2010/titleIII_2010/titleIII_2010_regulations.htm\">section of the ADA</a> related to the case reads as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Section 36.201(a) contains the general rule that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, and accommodations of any place of public accommodation.</p><p>Full and equal enjoyment means the right to participate and to have an equal opportunity to obtain the same results as others to the extent possible with such accommodations as may be required by the Act and these regulations. It does not mean that an individual with a disability must achieve an identical result or level of achievement as persons without a disability.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The 9th Circuit decided the ADA also applied to businesses on the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were three key issues in the case: whether the ADA applied to the website and app, whether Domino&#8217;s had fair notice to comply, and whether the court or the Department of Justice (DOJ) should decide the case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOJ is the body that regulates the ADA. Since it was signed into law in 1990, the DOJ has not created specific guidelines for how businesses can ensure their websites are within the law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One argument is that it would have been cheaper and easier for Domino&#8217;s to follow accessibility standards such as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).  Such arguments don&#8217;t address the need for meaningful regulations from a governing body.  The WCAG are not legal guidelines in the U.S. However, the 9th Circuit ruled that the lack of guidelines does not remove Domino&#8217;s responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Circuit Judge John B. Owens wrote in the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/18/18-1539/102950/20190613153344483_DominosPetitionAppendix.pdf\">9th Circuit decision</a>, &#8220;While we understand why Domino&#8217;s wants DOJ to issue specific guidelines for website and app accessibility, the Constitution only requires that Domino&#8217;s receive fair notice of its legal duties, not a blueprint for compliance with its statutory obligations.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of such regulations is why this case was important from Domino&#8217;s standpoint.  While they lost the case, it may further push the need for more specific guidelines for businesses, both large and small, to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The lack of specific regulations could also be seen as <em>a feature rather than a bug</em>, to use a developer phrase.  Government-specific rules are often slow to keep up with the changing nature of the web.  Guidelines that apply one day may need to change soon thereafter.  It also leaves businesses the ability to make their websites accessible via a method of their choice rather than limiting what they can do to potentially bureaucratic rules that are out of touch with the modern web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, it could leave smaller business owners without large legal and website development budgets wondering if they could be looking at lawsuits in the future.  Courts were flooded with <a href=\"https://www.3playmedia.com/2019/06/12/2018sweb-accessibility-lawsuits/\">2,285 accessibility lawsuits in 2018</a>, which was nearly triple the 814 cases in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Does This Mean for Website owners in the U.S.?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the case, the Supreme Court didn&#8217;t make a ruling.  They denied Domino&#8217;s petition and left the decision of the 9th Circuit in place, which covers much of the western U.S.  In the coming years, more cases will make their way through the courts.  More than likely, case law will continue becoming stronger in favor of making websites compliant with the ADA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run an online business, it&#8217;s past time to make sure your website is accessible.  It could be years before the current law is amended or new ones are written on the legislative level.  The winds of change will likely not favor those with inaccessible websites as more court decisions come down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, businesses with websites, apps, or other online presences need to make sure all people have access to their goods or services.  While there are no specific guidelines in the U.S., <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/\">WCAG</a> is the largely agreed-upon standards internationally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a small business owner using WordPress, you should start with a WordPress <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/accessibility-ready/\">theme labeled as accessibility-ready</a>.  It is worth noting that &#8220;accessibility-ready&#8221; does not mean that your website will automatically become accessible.  It simply means that the WordPress theme meets a minimum number of accessibility guidelines.  Custom content on your website should also follow the same guidelines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility is not a set-it-and-forget-it type of thing.  It&#8217;s something that business owners need to continually evaluate and make sure that all their customers, regardless of how that person accesses the internet, can enjoy the same services equally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official theme review team is working through a long-term plan to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-initiates-new-long-term-plan-to-make-all-wordpress-org-themes-accessible\">make all themes accessible</a> at WordPress.org.  Many theme businesses outside of WordPress.org also comply with those same guidelines.  If purchasing a theme, you should check with the business beforehand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, if you&#8217;re unsure whether your website meets legal guidelines, you&#8217;ll need to consult a lawyer who specializes in website accessibility.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Oct 2019 18:02:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Alice Orru\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=7288\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/10/people-of-wordpress-alice-orru/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8390:\"<p><em>You’ve probably heard that WordPress is open-source software, and may know that it’s created and run by volunteers. WordPress enthusiasts share many examples of how WordPress changed people’s lives for the better. This monthly series shares some of those lesser-known, amazing stories.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Meet Alice Orru, from Sardinia, Italy.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice Orru was born in Sardinia, an island in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. As a child, she dreamt of becoming a flight attendant, traveling the world, and speaking many foreign languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unable to meet the height requirements of her chosen profession, Orru ended up choosing a different path in life, following the Italian mantra: “You have to study something that will guarantee a stable and secure job for life.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The unemployment rate in Sardinia is very high, a challenge shared throughout the surrounding islands. In addition to that, Alice wasn’t that keen on having the same job all her life, as her parents had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Orru was 22 she moved to Siena, Tuscany, to finish her studies. That is when she created her first personal blog. The website was built on an Italian platform named Tiscali, which she later migrated to WordPress.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After 2 years in Tuscany Orru moved to Strasbourg, France. She studied French and worked several jobs while living there. Her first serious job was in Milan &#8211; working 40 hours/week in the marketing department of a large, international company. She found herself surrounded by ambitious colleagues and a boss who constantly requested extra —unpaid— working hours per day.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/IMG_2672.jpg?fit=632%2C422&ssl=1\" alt=\"Alice Orru\" class=\"wp-image-7291\" />Alice Orru\n\n\n\n<h2>Choices, choices, choices&#8230;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice gave up blogging because she wasn’t feeling inspired enough to write. She questioned whether she really wanted to do that job forever; working 10 hours per day under the neon lights of an office. It forced her to set aside her dreams for the time being, and for a while, she mainly lived for the weekends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice decided to leave the job and moved to Barcelona, Spain, all by herself, in 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few months of intense Spanish learning at the university, she found a job in an international clinic as a “Patient Coordinator.” Orru assisted international patients coming to Barcelona for their treatments. She acted as their translator, interpreter and administrative consultant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patients came from Italy, France, England, Morocco, Senegal, and several other countries. Alice was so inspired by some of their stories, that she started to write again: She dusted off her WordPress blog and filled it with stories about her new life in Barcelona and some of the women she met at the clinic. “I was feeling stronger and more independent than ever,” Orru expressed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Technical issues led to unexpected opportunities</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the summer of 2015, Alice was writing on her blog and got stuck with a technical problem. While she was searching through the WordPress.com documentation, she saw a pop-up in the bottom right corner of her screen. It was a staff member of Automattic, checking if she needed help. They chatted for a few minutes and the problem was solved. Alice left the chat with one question, though: how did that person on chat find a support job with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice found the official WordPress job page: <a href=\"http://jobs.wordpress.net/\"><strong>jobs.wordpress.net</strong></a> and noticed a job offer that caught her attention: WP Media, a French startup, was looking for a polyglot and remote customer service teammate for one of their plugins, WP Rocket. She read their requirements: fluency in English, French and possibly other languages, excellent experience with WordPress, and some coding skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She knew she didn’t meet all the requirements, but could speak 4 languages, and she had a WordPress blog. She didn’t know anything about PHP, though. Orru had been a WordPress.com user for years and knew she was ready to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Orru wrote a cover letter and sent her CV. A Skype interview was conducted and several days later she received the news that she had gotten the job!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>A steep learning curve</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The early days in her new job were intense. Alice felt inexperienced but was supported by her teammates. She started studying and reading everything about WordPress for beginners. Initially, she answered easy tickets from customers. All the while her teammates were sending useful material to read, setting up video-calls for 1 to 1 training, and encouraging her the entire time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, Orru was replying to customers whose first language was either Spanish or Italian in their native language. This was much appreciated and resulted in several happy comments. Until that moment the plugin’s support had been offered only in English and French.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Finding her way in the WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Paris 2016, one of Alice’s teammates introduced her to how the WordPress community collaborated and kept in contact through Slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You speak multiple languages, why don’t you try to contribute to the polyglots team?” he asked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alice knew very little about contributing to WordPress. She had only been working for WP Media for 6 months and didn’t feel ready to dive into a new challenge and start also contributing to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, curiosity led her to join both the local Italian and the global WordPress Community on Slack. For the first few months, she mainly observed what was happening the channels. Then, she attended WordCamp Milan and met some members of the Italian Polyglots team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was love at first string! Laura, one of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/?locale=it_IT\"><strong>General Translation Editors</strong></a> (GTE) for Italy, taught her how to start contributing and translating, following the polyglots guidelines. She also told her about the Italian community’s big efforts to work together, consistently, to boost and grow WordPress related events in Italy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With her teammates’ encouragement, Orru applied to WordCamps as a speaker and gave her first talk in December 2016 at WordCamp Barcelona. After that, she both spoke at WordCamp Torino on April 2017 and at WordCamp Europe in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2019/10/aliceorru-wordcamp-europe.jpg?fit=632%2C356&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7292\" />Alice Orru speaking at WordCamp Europe, in Paris, in 2017\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Dreams evolve, all the time!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Orru knows that her experiences are not just due to luck. She used her previous skills and passions and adapted them to a new career and life path.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“We all have some skills; and if we don’t know which they are exactly, we should take some time to make a list of the things we’re really good at.

This is the second edition of the virtual WooCommerce event hosted by <a href=\"https://wpsessions.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPSessions</a>. In addition to presentations focused entirely on e-commerce, the event will include a &#8220;Hallway Track&#8221; that offers opportunities for attendees to connect with each other, along with virtual swag donated by various WordPress companies.</p>\n<p>Day 1 will cover a wide range of topics for WooCommerce professionals with a focus on store builders, including sessions on designing with blocks, sales tax, optimizing the checkout experience, and store emails. The first day will also feature a two-hour &#8220;State of the Woo&#8221; keynote address from the WooCommerce team. They plan to discuss case studies, lessons learned, and priorities for the year ahead.</p>\n<p>Day 2 will focus on more technical topics for WooCommerce developers, such as &#8220;Custom Tables and the Checkout Bottleneck,&#8221; solving store UX problems, and productizing development work.</p>\n<p>The event is being organized by Brian Richards and Patrick Rauland. For the past two years it has been the official successor to the previously held in-person WooConf events. Given how successful WooSesh has been in connecting the WooCommerce community, it&#8217;s easy to see why WooConf has not yet been reinstated.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One thing I can say, having helped three WooConfs and both WooSesh&#8217;s, is that a virtual event is a fraction of the cost,&#8221; Rauland said. &#8220;And we had twice as many people show up live for WooSesh compared to an in person event.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In 2018, WooSesh had 2,800 registrants and more than 1,400 who participated live during the event. Rauland reported that 900 people watched the keynote address.

This change means that plugin authors can now use newer PHP syntax in plugins they submit to the official plugin directory.  In the future, the version maximum will match what&#8217;s running on WordPress.org.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This should be good news for any plugin developers who are using newer PHP syntax.  Previously, authors were able to submit code using newer PHP functions if they had a compatibility check in the same file.  However, newer syntax wasn&#8217;t allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The issue was that the Linter (being stuck on 7.0) prevented anyone from checking in code via SVN that used 7.1+ standards,&#8221; said Mika Epstein from the plugin review team.  &#8220;So things like the Spaceship operator would fail on commit and you&#8217;d be told the syntax was invalid. This was holding back certain plugins from committing code into the directory.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epstein first opened a <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/3791\">ticket to address the issue</a> 13 months ago but said she&#8217;d been quietly asking for a fix for a while longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The max PHP version isn&#8217;t listed anywhere in the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-org/\">plugin guidelines</a>.  Technically, it&#8217;s an SVN limitation on WordPress.org and not something the plugin team chose.  However, for plugin authors, they may not have known about the issue until their plugin was rejected by the system.  They would then message the plugin team about the problem.  &#8220;I may end up putting something in the docs, but it&#8217;s a somewhat uncommon occurrence,&#8221; said Epstein.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been an issue for some plugin authors since PHP 7.1 was released, which was December 1, 2016.  &#8220;It was a once a year issue, then twice, and then it inched up to every couple months,&#8221; said Epstein.  &#8220;As of September, at least once a month someone would hit this and complain to plugins.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One potential problem with blocking newer PHP code is with plugins that rely on third-party libraries, which may only have security patches in more recent versions.  However, Epstein said that she was not aware of any security issues that resulted from the version limitation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrey &#8220;Rarst&#8221; Savchenko pointed out in the ticket that &#8220;7.2 was released almost two years ago.&#8221;  While he says it&#8217;s an improvement over the previous 7.0 limitation, version 7.2 should not be a hard ceiling for plugins in the repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.3 was released on December 16, 2018, and PHP 7.4 <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/first-look-at-php-7-4-for-wordpress-developers\">will be released</a> on November 28, 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Given PHP&#8217;s poor adoption curves,&#8221; responded Dion Hulse, &#8220;all that this means is that you can&#8217;t release a plugin through WordPress.org that only works on 15% of WordPress sites.  &#8220;You can even use newer functions in PHP if including compat code, just not newer syntax.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugin author Josh Pollock <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Josh412/status/1100487567236059136\">called awareness to the issue</a> on Twitter in February.  &#8220;Hours later, I&#8217;m downgrading a dependency, because it requires another dependency, which requires PHP 7.1.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think we got lucky and there were no bugs,&#8221; Pollock said of downgrading to an earlier version of the dependency.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve used SVN since. I&#8217;m really fortunate that&#8217;s not a part of my life anymore.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I agree with Rarst,&#8221; said Pollock.  &#8220;We should be allowing for PHP 7 and making it easier for plugins not to support sites on out of date versions of PHP.&#8221;  This echoes the sentiment of other developers who are pushing for WordPress to adopt newer standards or at least allow them to do so in their own plugins in the official directory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the majority of plugin authors, this should be a non-issue as long as the SVN system remains updated to match the version of PHP used on WordPress.og.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.2 will lose active support on November 30, 2019, and security support on November 30, 2020.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Oct 2019 16:41:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:134:\"WPTavern: Matt Mullenweg and David Heinemeier Hansson Discuss WordPress Market Share, Monopolies, and Power in Open Source Communities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94234\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:143:\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-and-david-heinemeier-hansson-discuss-wordpress-market-share-monopolies-and-power-in-open-source-communities\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18041:\"<p>In what began as a heated conversation on Twitter, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg and Ruby on Rails creator and Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson took to the airwaves to debate opposing viewpoints on market share, monopolies, and power in open source communities.

He also referenced Shopify as having a thriving business with a small percentage of the e-commerce platform market share.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Even though open source can become a bit of a standard, it doesn&#8217;t prevent others from starting on it,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;The truth is if I had an evil hat on &#8211; let&#8217;s say I started doing evil monopoly stuff, people could easily fork the software &#8211; and they would. There&#8217;s a checks and balances there.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-governance-project-looks-for-new-leadership\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">classic power dynamic in BDFL-led open source projects</a> where the potential for a fork checks the project leader&#8217;s actions.</p>\n<p>Hansson challenges Mullenweg&#8217;s assertion that a fork would be a threat to the project, arguing that this power is illusionary when a project has become as dominant as WordPress:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Technically someone could fork Ruby on Rails tomorrow. What is the likelihood that fork is going to succeed? Once you have this juggernaut of network effects, WordPress is growing so much faster than anyone else, the gravitational pull is huge. Should someone fork it, introducing incompatibilities, what is the likelihood that is going to be a serious contender? From me, my assessment is extremely low, just the same as if someone was to fork Ruby on Rails today and call it Snoopy on Pails. The odds of that being anything other than a curiosity for two days on Hacker News is extremely low.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The notion of Snoopy on Pails injected a bit of humor into the debate that remained high intensity for the hour-long discussion, but it also illustrated Hansson&#8217;s point regarding the absurdity of any kind of WordPress fork becoming a real threat to the project&#8217;s momentum.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">it was a privilege to have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> come on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reworkpodcast?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@reworkpodcast</a> and debate <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dhh</a> on tech monopolies and power dynamics in open source: <a href=\"https://t.co/Aewq4QTwFe\">https://t.co/Aewq4QTwFe</a>.

The whole reason someone is able to raise that kind of money is off the back of someone who can pitch: &#8216;We have over a third of all websites on the internet and we think we can get to 85%.&#8217; That&#8217;s a very compelling venture story.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg counters that if a Rails fork couldn&#8217;t attract a lot of users, that speaks to the Hansson&#8217;s stewardship of the project. He said that a typical WordPress release has 400-500 contributors with an estimated 10% from Automattic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If 200 of those went someplace else because I did something really brain dead, that would be a pretty serious competitor, and there are some examples of that in open source history,&#8221; Mullenweg said. He contended that forks with enough weight behind them can become very interesting. On this point the two project leaders remained at odds.</p>\n<h3>How Open Source Market Dominance Impacts Diversity of Tools and Services on the Web</h3>\n<p>One of Hansson&#8217;s chief concerns with WordPress reaching 85% market share is what he described as the &#8220;death of diversity.&#8221; He perceives this pursuit of increased adoption as growing open source in monopolistic ways.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re living through an era right now where a small handful of big tech companies are exerting a completely undue amount of power over the internet, over discourse, over all sorts of things, and that&#8217;s something we should try to recoil from and at least learn from, not aspire to building more of,&#8221; Hansson said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what got this going &#8211; why isn&#8217;t WordPress in a great place only being a third of all the sites of the internet. Why does it need to get to 85%? Why does its growth need to be that explosive and that wild?&#8221;</p>\n<p>This is a question many in the WordPress community have asked in the past. Does the mission of democratizing publishing necessitate such a zealous drive towards market dominance?</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to see this concentration of power in one engine, no matter how good it is,&#8221; Hansson said.</p>\n<p>It is at this juncture that Mullenweg revealed more of his vision for WordPress becoming the &#8220;operating system of the web,&#8221; an idea he has floated several times over the past few years.</p>\n<p>&#8220;You have referred to WordPress a lot of times as blogging,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I think of it more like a platform. If you look at how a lot of people are building on it, they use WordPress to bootstrap something that doesn&#8217;t look like WordPress at all. It might not even have a website. It might be powering just an API. It might be a headless or decoupled installation. It could be a store.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He likened the idea to Apache and nginx having a dominant market share (<a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/web-and-application-servers/apache-http-server-market-share\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">55%</a> and <a href=\"https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/web-and-application-servers/nginx-market-share\">23%</a> respectively) in the server space.</p>\n<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prevent the different types of websites that are built on it,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;If nginx got to 80 or 85%, that wouldn&#8217;t prevent the diversity or what people could put on their websites. WordPress could get to 85% and it wouldn&#8217;t mean that there&#8217;s any sort of monoculture or lack of diversity. If anything, it would allow people to focus more on what&#8217;s different and not recreating the WYSIWYG, the user system, the login, all that stuff we have all built a million times and you just don&#8217;t need to anymore, if something like WordPress solves your needs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hansson asked what it would look like if 85% of the web ran on WordPress, a question that the community behind the project hasn&#8217;t deeply examined yet. He encouraged listeners to consider what they want the internet to look like in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>What is the future I&#8217;d like to live in? What does a healthy, open, free internet look like? To me it looks like an internet with tons of different providers, tons of different tools, and what we collaborate around is protocols, not consolidation of software market share, that gives individuals and companies or even projects outsized power to dictate the matters of the internet.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Matt clarified that his comments on an 85% market share are not a goal, but rather a &#8220;trailing indicator&#8221; in the quest to create the best possible experience for developers and users. A growing market share is a signal of adoption in that sense, not a goal in itself.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Community Reactions to the Debate</h3>\n<p>After the initial exchange on Twitter, the broader tech community seemed delighted to hear Mullenweg and Hansson square off in a civil debate on topics that affect so many people working on the web. The conversation touched on a lot of the friction points in the WordPress ecosystem with Automattic being one of the most powerful companies driving WordPress&#8217; market share. Many listeners were grateful for answers to questions they have had for years.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Not sure <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@dhh</a> realizes it, but he spoke for hundreds if not thousands of WordPress community members that have had similar questions for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@photomatt</a> spanning the last few years. Most aren’t afforded the same opportunity or carry the same clout to have it.  <a href=\"https://t.co/z7wSIGJKAZ\">https://t.co/z7wSIGJKAZ</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Medeiros (@mattmedeiros) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattmedeiros/status/1179201126878629888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 2, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>However, the idea of WordPress as web infrastructure and the level of market dominance (85%) discussed in the podcast are controversial and even off-putting for some who are deeply invested in the platform.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Matt appears to think of WordPress as infrastructure for the web, in the same way that Google and Facebook think of themselves as infrastructure for the web,&#8221; Morten Rand-Hendriksen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In the conversation about the dangers of market control, monopolization, and monoculture, Matt says, &#8216;We are not a grain, we are the soil.&#8217; The only way to interpret that from my position is &#8216;WordPress is not a thing on the web. It is the web,&#8217; i.e. infrastructure. A future where WP is web infrastructure is something I think very few people actually want, open source or not.&#8221;</p>\n<p>On the podcast, Mullenweg argued that open source allows for competition in a way proprietary software does not, but Rand-Hendriksen said he sees this as a logical fallacy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He talks at the same time about WP being infrastructure and powering 85% of the web AND about this being a reason for others to fight it with other solutions,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So monopolization leads to competition somehow. I don&#8217;t think WordPress is infrastructure, or that it should power 85% of the web, especially after hearing this conversation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If we truly believe in this idea of open source as diversification and forking, WP should actively support other projects and try to not be the dominant force on the web. WP is not infrastructure, it is very much a grain that has become a monoculture.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Matt Medeiros, host of the <a href=\"http://youtube.com/themattreport\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Report podcast</a> focused on WordPress business and entrepreneurs, said that while the conversation answered a lot of questions, it left him wanting more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cloud of uncertainty that hangs above a large portion of this community is directly formed from lack of clear communication in both <a href=\"http://WordPress.org\">WordPress.org</a> and how Automattic + Jetpack move in lockstep with the open source project,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;As we see hundreds of millions of dollars invested, with billions of dollars of valuation going to a single company, surely the optics leave one wondering how all of this gets repaid to investors?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Automattic invariably comes under more public scrutiny regarding its investments due to having the WordPress project lead as its CEO. One interesting observation Mullenweg made during podcast is that Automattic is just one of many larger players that make up the the WordPress economy, which he has previously estimated at $10 billion/year.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Automattic makes probably 2-3% of the revenue in the WordPress world,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;There are companies like GoDaddy, which might not contribute very much back to core, but probably have 3 or 4 times the number of subscribers than us running WordPress. I think about that a lot. I want to grow the whole ecosystem, not just our slice of it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Revenue is not always equal to influence, and a good portion of the end of the podcast tackled questions about power and leadership in open source.</p>\n<p>&#8220;David&#8217;s questions are spun from the threads that fear monopoly on the web, as much as we fear a singular rule of decision making in the open source project,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;I think David did well at challenging Matt&#8217;s view on the desire of world domination and how undesirable it is to earn the title of Benevolent Dictator &#8212; but it left me wanting more. For example, in an attempt to throw a curveball, Matt pointed out, the investment is made in Automattic &#8212; not WordPress &#8212; a point so opaque it didn&#8217;t fool David, but didn&#8217;t have him pressing any deeper.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Had David viewed this conversation through the lens of our community, he would know that Automattic and WordPress.com enjoy the full benefit of leveraging the WordPress brand, a brand protected by a foundation that Matt himself founded, which may have guided the podcast episode into the ethics of it all.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Mullenweg&#8217;s claim that &#8220;WordPress belongs to you as much as it belongs to anyone else&#8221; is true in the sense that the software is freely available to be used and modified by anyone, the full power of <a href=\"http://wpandlegalstuff.com/using-wordpress-trademarks-business-product-service/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">leveraging the WordPress brand</a> does not belong to everyone.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think Matt would have been willing to have this kind of conversation with me or most members from the the general community, so I&#8217;m glad someone of David&#8217;s clout was able to engage here,&#8221; Medeiros said. &#8220;I do sympathize with all that Matt is responsible for and it&#8217;s not a challenge I think I&#8217;d be up for, given the opportunity. I love this community and want to see people stay, contribute, and flourish &#8212; not walk away because they felt unheard. DHH isn&#8217;t the hero we asked for, but he&#8217;s the hero we need right now. Hopefully he continues to keep a watchful eye over where WordPress is heading.&#8221;</p>\n<p>If you only listen to one podcast this week, <a href=\"https://rework.fm/open-source-and-power-with-matt-mullenweg/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Hansson&#8217;s conversation with Mullenweg</a> is an invigorating battle of opposing open source ideals held as a respectful exchange. In defending their positions, both reveal how their experiences of the early days of the web shaped their ideologies and approaches to open source project leadership and commercialization. Conversations like these are rare but long overdue, as the WordPress community considers its growing influence on the future of the web.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Oct 2019 18:59:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: WordPress Theme Review Team Brings Back Review Shindigs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94599\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-review-team-brings-back-review-shindigs\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3730:\"<p>The WordPress theme review team (TRT) is kicking off a review weekend October 5 and will begin at 10:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  These events, called &#8220;review shindigs,&#8221; are marathon sessions where the team joins together to review themes and teach best practices.  The current plan is to hold the event on the first Saturday of every month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The goal of the review weekend is to get together and do as many quality reviews as possible,&#8221; wrote Carolina Nymark, one of the team&#8217;s review representatives, in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/10/03/review-weekend\">event&#8217;s announcement</a>.  Events sometimes have different goals, depending on what the team needs to work on at the time.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the event will happen over the team&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/themereview\">Slack channel</a>.  They will also hold a live presentation or Q&amp;A on Zoom at 13:00 UTC.  Anyone is welcome to attend (the Zoom link will be provided in Slack).  This will help teach those who are interested in how to perform reviews and check common issues.  Anyone attending is also able to submit topics for discussion in the comments on the announcement post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TRT originally <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2019/09/24/meeting-notes-for-tuesday-24th-september-2019/\">announced plans</a> for the event after the last team meeting, but it was overshadowed by other news, such as the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/theme-review-team-restructures-into-project-representatives\">team moving to a flat structure</a>.  &#8220;Not sure if anyone but myself will be there,&#8221; joked Nymark.  &#8220;It&#8217;s short notice.  Some of the team reps already had other plans.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyone from the WordPress community is allowed to participate in the event by simply commenting on a ticket without being assigned a review.  Nymark provided links on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/\">how to become a reviewer</a> and the team&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/onboarding-for-new-reviewers/\">reviewer onboarding process</a> to get new reviewers started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Review shindigs can help new reviewers because it puts them in touch with more experienced reviewers at a time when they know someone will be online to answer questions.  They&#8217;re also a team-building exercise where people can join together and work toward a common goal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/\">214 tickets</a> are awaiting review. A successful event would significantly cut that number down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Events From the Past</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme review shindigs have seen varying levels of success over the years.  In the TRT&#8217;s earliest days, review gatherings were regular events and helped keep the ever-growing ticket queue under control.  Participation waned over time as leaders within the team switched to other projects or no longer had time to run the events.  Proposals to bring back them back have not gone far in the last couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last TRT shindig was a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2016/12/05/december-shindig-recap/\">December 2016 event</a> that saw over 50 participants.  Reviewers worked on 108 tickets throughout the weekend.  The event also coincided with contributor day at WordCamp US, which helped bump up participation numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jose Castaneda, Cristiano Zanca, Benjamin Lu, and Afzaal Ahmed held a live stream that covered how to load scripts and styles in themes in the previous review event.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Oct 2019 18:29:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:27:\"Matt: Debating OSS with DHH\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=50262\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://ma.tt/2019/10/debating-oss-with-dhh/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:931:\"<p>The other week I ended up going back and forth in tweets with <a href=\"https://dhh.dk/\">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, it wasn&#8217;t going anywhere but he graciously invited me to their podcast and we were able to expand the discussion in a way I found really refreshing and mind-opening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DHH and I have philosophies around work and open source that I believe overlap 95% or more, so that makes where we have differences all that more interesting to mine.

WordPress 5.3 will also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/47783\">include several commits</a> that address deprecated features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s unlikely that most WordPress plugin and theme developers will be able to use the new PHP 7.4 features for a while except when working on setups where they have some measure of control over the environment.  Given WordPress&#8217; reluctance to bump the minimum PHP version to the latest supported versions, it could be years before it&#8217;s safe to use new features.  However, developers should make sure their plugins and themes are compatible with 7.4.  It&#8217;s also good practice to keep up with current features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.2 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/05/jaco/\">bumped the minimum requirement</a> to PHP 5.6 with a recommendation of PHP 7.3.  The following is the breakdown for current <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">PHP usage stats</a> for WordPress installs:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>PHP 7.3 &#8211; 9.6%</li><li>PHP 7.2 &#8211; 22.2%</li><li>PHP 7.1 &#8211; 13.5%</li><li>PHP 7.0 &#8211; 14.9%</li><li>PHP 5.6 &#8211; 25.7%</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, PHP 7.2 and 7.3 are the only versions receiving active support.  PHP will drop security support for version 7.1 on December 1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.4 includes a number of <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.php\">new features</a> that will make writing code easier.  The following is a small overview of some of the features that will likely be useful for WordPress plugin and theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Typed Properties</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP first introduced type hinting in 5.0 and has continued improving the feature.  PHP 7.0 introduced return type declarations.  PHP 7.4 steps it up a notch and allows developers to declare types for class properties.  This lets developers make sure the type of data assigned to a specific property is always that data type.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following example, the <code>$id</code> property can only be assigned an integer and the <code>$title</code> property a string.  Attempting to assign the wrong data type will result in a fatal error if strict types are declared.  Otherwise, PHP will coerce the value to the correct type.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\nclass Event {\n\n    public int $id;\n\n    public string $title;\n}\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Arrow Functions</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Many developers have been clamoring for arrow functions similar to JavaScript. They are pretty sweet to use.  However, PHP&#8217;s arrow functions, also called &#8220;short closures,&#8221; are slightly different.  PHP 7.4 introduces the <code>fn</code> keyword (now a reserved keyword).  Short closures can only contain one expression and have no <code>return</code> keyword.  They&#8217;re not quite as powerful as their JavaScript cousins, but they do offer a quick solution for some scenarios.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the following code snippet shows two different ways to build an array of user emails from a collection of user objects.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\n// Old way, but still acceptable.\n$value = array_map( function( $user ) {\n    return $user-&gt;user_email;\n}, $users );\n\n// New way.\n$value = array_map( fn( $user ) =&gt; $user-&gt;user_email, $users );\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Unpacking Inside of Arrays</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Argument unpacking was <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration56.new-features.php\">introduced in PHP 5.6</a>, so this may still be unfamiliar territory for many developers in the WordPress space.  It&#8217;s been an invaluable feature in some of my projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.4 allows developers to unpack an array within an array.  This should be faster than <code>array_merge()</code> because the spread operator (<code>...</code>) is a language construct rather than a function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Consider the following example of injecting an array of two colors within a larger array of colors.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\n$colors_a = [ \'green\', \'blue\' ];\n\n$colors_b = [ \'red\', ...$colors_a, \'yellow\', \'purple\' ];\n\n// [ \'red\', \'green\', \'blue\', \'yellow\', \'purple\' ];\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Null Coalescing Assignment Operator</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The null coalescing assignment operator is a shorthand way of combining an <code>isset()</code> check with a ternary operator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following example shows how to check the <code>$product[\'id\']</code> variable.  If it&#8217;s set, do nothing.  Else, assign it the value on the right.  You can see the evolution of the code between PHP versions.  It&#8217;s much simpler to write in 7.4.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\n// Pre-PHP 7.0.\n$product[\'id\'] = isset( $product[\'id\'] ) ? $product[\'id\'] : 0;\n\n// PHP 7.0.\n$product[\'id\'] = $product[\'id\'] ?? 0;\n\n// PHP 7.4.\n$product[\'id\'] ??= 0;\n</pre>\n\n\n<h2>Deprecated Features</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>PHP 7.4 will deprecate several features.  Plugin and theme authors will want to <a href=\"https://www.php.net/manual/en/migration74.deprecated.php\">consult the complete list</a> to determine whether they should update any outdated code.  I cherry-picked a few items that I&#8217;ve seen in plugin and theme code over the last few years.  Most other deprecated features are unlikely in current code bases.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Nested Ternary Operators Without Parenthesis</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Nested ternary operators are generally something you should avoid as a developer.  Seriously.  Just don&#8217;t write them.  They&#8217;re tough to follow and are prone to bugs due to human error.  However, if you&#8217;re going to throw caution to the wind and dismiss good advice, at least use parenthesis.  PHP 7.4 deprecated nested ternaries without them.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\n// Not OK (deprecated).\n$value = $a ? $b : $c ? $d : $e;\n\n// OK.\n$value = ( $a ? $b : $c ) ? $d : $e;\n\n// OK.\n$value = $a ? $b : ( $c ? $d : $e );\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Using array_key_exists() on Objects</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Developers should not use <code>array_key_exists()</code> on objects simply because objects are not arrays.  Instead, use the more appropriate <code>property_exists()</code> function or <code>isset()</code>.</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"brush: php; gutter: false; title: ; wrap-lines: false; notranslate\">\n// Not OK (deprecated).\nif ( array_key_exists( $property, $object ) ) {}\n\n// OK.\nif ( property_exists( $object, $property ) ) {}\n\n// OK.\nif ( isset( $object-&gt;$property ) ) {}\n</pre>\n\n\n<h3>Array and String Offset Access With Curly Braces</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Using curly braces for array and string offset access is a bit more of a rarity, but I&#8217;ve seen it in the wild a couple of times.

It also opens up the world of block creation. BP core contributors and community developers will have a much easier time creating blocks, since Gutenberg mainly uses REST.</p>\n<p>In anticipation of BP blocks, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-5-0-to-add-category-for-storing-buddypress-blocks\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">5.0 includes a new panel in the block inserter</a> that allows developers to organize their custom blocks under a BuddyPress category.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/buddypress-blocks-panel.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>BuddyPress 6.0 <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8048\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">may include core blocks for specific components</a> and core blocks may ultimately replace the plugin&#8217;s existing widgets.

The team leads are now ‘representatives’ of different areas of the work that they do. This flat structure allows for representatives to work in more loosely defined areas so they contribute to the team in more diverse ways, and helps the team to be more focused on setting and achieving their goals.

Last one was obvious and not because of money. I didn’t know how high or low my chances are even I had very good marks. I could have been just the biggest fish in the pond, but I wanted to leave people who treat me like expense item as soon as possible anyway. I made up my mind and it’s separated me from my classmates. I got secondary school certificate and left school instantly without goodbyes.</p>\n<p>My knowledge of opportunities was very narrow. I thought to be an ecologist or guide translator from German, based on what I was taught at school, or an advertiser, it was ads boom in Russia, ads were fascinating, and I collected flyers. At the same time, I was already good a computer user and did a lot of typing for one of the school&#8217;s principals, sometimes instead of classes, volunteered once and they couldn’t say “no”.</p>\n<p>No one bothered to give me advice, but I was sure my future was unimaginable without computers and came to a general decision to be a programmer. The range of technical schools was not wide, and names of specializations looked very abstruse. I messed up and spend four years studying transistor markings, soldering and drawing PCB layouts. Programming course turns out to be a bit of a joke, it was Pascal, we didn’t even try to do something useful with it. English course was another flaw in this education, the teacher was busy showing off and teasing girls. I&#8217;m not sure if he even knew the subject. He was fired after our collective petition. We got good marks just to forget about it. I left technical school with honors degree and improved typing skills.</p>\n<p>It was wild unfriendly market I faced. I didn’t know how to recognize a normal job offer from sinister one, so I bumped into several, like banging in people’s doors and pitch them in buying cheap stuff for very high price. It was harassing and I have no idea how long I would’ve looked for work without help.</p>\n<h3>The wrong approach can cause failure</h3>\n<p>I was lucky to have a father in an IT company. He proposed me like a substitute to typists when I was still a student and when I finished, helped me to get a job on updating a law system on client’s computers. Maybe I could get it by coming from the street, but I had to know where the entrance is. Half a year later I got a full-time job in the same service department and started to play volleyball with colleagues. It was great to meet people from other departments and on the field was no big difference between director and analyst, it’s fair play. I liked my place and my clients, but I was “friendly” told that without a university degree I will have no further promotions.</p>\n<p>At this time, I tried to study PHP by a book. It was very exciting at first, but a lot of functions without explanation how to build something useful with them didn’t make much sense and when I tried, I failed and backed off. It was hard to admit a fail even to myself and it was nagging me for a long time.</p>\n<p>I had to choose something I can handle; I’m interested in and can afford. It turned out to be advertising. I spent most of my and my husband’s holidays on sessions in the next 6 years. It was tricky for him to make me to leave a computer, once I was glued to it, so he bought me my first laptop. English was still hard for me, I got my high marks just memorizing all the words in a textbook and how they must sound. Again, I wanted something I cannot handle.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I started to hate my workplace long before I finished education with another honor degree no one was interested in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I got a promotion quite soon despite apprehensions but then my chief was dismissed and with new one the things became very tense; I escaped to have a baby and spent a whole three years on child’s care holidays full of doubts. I tried to get off by studying, drawing and baking but the pram was pulling me back. I didn’t use to stay put, rely on my husband’s money and be separate from other people. I didn’t want to come back, but it looked like I have no better choice, I was convinced (overall, rightly) that not too many companies want in office position a woman with small baby and lots of sick leaves.</p>\n<p>After I returned at work it became clear that the situation in my department was unhealthier than ever, I lost my place and next boss treated all back-office girls like pieces of furniture. In a few months I had enough.</p>\n<h3>The flip side of the coin can become a black swan</h3>\n<p>I wanted to be a marketer. Knowing how tricky it is to sell intangibles, I wanted solid product to work with. Now I see that it isn&#8217;t a point at all.</p>\n<p>It turned out to be difficult to find a job outside IT, some HRs was kind enough to answer that with my experience I’ll better be in IT.</p>\n<p>Still I was very hopeful, studied hard and considered myself well, but once again I set a low bar to my employers. Companies I worked in wanted to get all publicity and sales rise through a cost of my salaries. I was careless once, the next time I asked specifically about budget before signing up and was assured, but still they meant my wages. It was a tough period of disappointments.</p>\n<p>When I was offered a part-time administrative job with “ok” to sick leaves, I took it gladly like a reprieve. It was far from home, and I was spending 2-3 hours a day on buses with Harry Potter audio books for company. In these traffic jams I started to feel English at last and loved it, it gave me a freedom no money can buy. And despite the long way I managed to play volleyball with my husband and his colleagues. Life was getting better.</p>\n<p>This job itself in addition to low payment had something valuable to me — a working website. After my boss had a row with its developer, I got it to maintain, did some reverse engineering and understood how it works. It wasn’t a most creative site, but it gave me a view. I started to write simple sites from scratch.</p>\n<blockquote><p>My first JavaScript calculator almost made me crazy, but I pursued.</p></blockquote>\n<p>From time to time I was asked for help from a friend or relative, usually to solve some urgent problems. So, I started to meet popular CMSs. One of the first I met with was WordPress. There was some issue in theme, which was changed and dropped by developer. I was digging a whole weekend deciphering how it works and found infinity loop to fix. Back then for me it was just a system…</p>\n<p>Two years later I found myself still clinging to my temporary job. I was tired of working for a hard nosed dictator, the last drop was his statement that I was not a programmer, because he hadn’t seen anything I made. I’ve already written some parts of website he asked for, so it was just unfair. I became angry and it was exactly what I needed, a big kick.</p>\n<p>I went out but still had no courage to pretend on a developer’s place and landed in some franchise company selling “box version” websites. It was another tough half of a year with a lot of work, low payment and plan failures, ending with pneumonia. I see now that I was making a disservice to customers, websites are not a microwave meal — quick, cheap and dummy. There was no life in them without a lot of work no one bargained to buy or do. Most of the sites I sold back then died when year expired but they never were truly alive and useful.</p>\n<h3>You need to pluck up your courage to become lucky</h3>\n<p>When I recovered, I search through developer’s job offers, but it was difficult to find something suitable worth trying to apply. I was reading job advertising and it looked, and still is, like mostly IT company are presented and they want geniuses who know a lot of technologies and frameworks at once. It was very distressing just to look.</p>\n<p>And then I became lucky again. I opened a private ads site and almost immediately found a job which was fitted me perfectly — they wanted someone with experience to write from scratch, understand another’s code and maintain it, ability to translate technical documentation and articles and make simple design of printing products. I made test task and there was no need in my resume or diplomas, I was taken. It’s turned out direct ad from one of sales departments in tech company and I passed by HR, who most likely wouldn&#8217;t even have considered me. Superior agreed to have me remotely most of the time, it solved sick leaves problem even if it was already much better than before. Addition to better salaries and calm work without over hours, I got very pleasant colleagues. We are friends ever since, despite back then no one guessed to invite me to play volleyball.</p>\n<p>It was 14 years after the original decision to be a programmer and it was only the beginning. I left this amazing place a couple years later when it held no more challenges for me.</p>\n<h3>Conscious decisions require wide knowledge</h3>\n<p>After I worked with a bunch of CMSs, I started to be able to compare them and understood not only that WordPress is the best one for developers and clients but also that I didn’t see right examples at all. The biggest flaw of WordPress — it’s so easy to make things work that there&#8217;s no need to bother and do things right and this becomes a problem later. I also saw bad cases on very different systems… and did them as well.</p>\n<p>I used to work relying on examples at hand, documentation and Google, but searching for a specific feature or a solution, I found myself again missing the whole picture. At this point Udemy courses came very handy and then I started to attend WordPress events, firstly online and then by foot, trains and airplanes and discovered a wide and very alive community. Now I know not only where to look but whom to ask and how to be not far from those who stays on top of things as much as possible. Most important is that I found allies who don’t think I’m going crazy, speaking with shining eyes about work, with whom I share a passion and fondness to WordPress. It’s what matters.</p>\n<p>Now, after 6 years of full time in development, I still feel myself like a newbie, it’s endless learning, frequent discoveries, mistakes and impassable wish to do better…</p>\n<h3>The way is the destination</h3>\n<p>I made a path very uneven, a lot of mess and banging, but for me it’s like a kaleidoscope where a little turn presents a new picture, new “a-ha” moment, new excitement after seemingly pointless efforts. When in doubt I remind myself about David Ogilvy who tried a lot of things before struck gold with advertising and it’s maybe why.</p>\n<p>Finally, I learned not only to keep face and move forward but also to dare.</p>\n<h3>Freedom is to make your own mind</h3>\n<p>I left my last workplace after we finished exhausted two years project on another CMS system which was a big reinventing of wheels and made up my mind to work only with WordPress from now on and dare to be my own boss.</p>\n<p>Now I’m officially an entrepreneur. This big boy’s stuff looks difficult. But I don’t want to be told, collaboration is a new black wherever I look.</p>\n<h2 id=\"ru\">Крюк длинной в 14 лет</h2>\n<blockquote><p>Не достаточно знать, что хочешь</p></blockquote>\n<p>В 15 лет мне было сказано, чтобы я поспешила с профессиональным образованием, если не поступлю бесплатно в институт, никто платить за меня не будет. Последнее было очевидно и не из-за денег. Несмотря на весьма хорошие оценки, я не могла оценить свои шансы, могло оказаться, что я просто большая рыба в маленьком пруду. Но в любом случае, я хотела как можно быстрей расстаться с людьми, видящими во мне одну большую статью расходов. Я приняла решение и это откололо меня от моих одноклассников. Ушла из школы я, не прощаясь, как только получила на руки сертификат об окончании 9 классов.</p>\n<p>Нужно было выбрать профессию, но потенциальные возможности были весьма туманны. Я могла стать экологом или немецкоязычным гид-переводчиком, на основе того, чему училась в школе, или рекламщиком, в России тогда начался рекламный бум, и она казалась очень захватывающей, я даже листовки собирала. В то же самое время я уже была хорошим пользователем компьютера и набирала документы для завуча старших классов, иногда вместо занятий — вызвалась один раз и потом уже не могла сказать «нет».</p>\n<p>Никто не пытался дать мне совет, но я была уверена, что будущее немыслимо без компьютеров и решила стать программистом. Выбор техникумов в пределах разумной досягаемости, был не очень большой, а названия специальностей выглядели очень мудрено. Я ошиблась и провела следующие 4 года изучая маркировку транзисторов, паяя и чертя печатные платы. Курс программирования обернулся дурной шуткой, это был Паскаль, и мы даже не пытались сделать с ним что-то полезное. Другим серьезным недостатком этого обучения стал английский язык, преподаватель выпендривался и задирал девушек, я так и не поняла знал ли он язык вообще. В конце концов он был уволен после нашей коллективной жалобы, а мы получили хорошие оценки, в качестве решения проблемы. Я выпустилась из техникума с красным дипломом и улучшенными навыками машинистки.</p>\n<p>Рынок труда был диким и неизведанным. Не зная, как распознать сомнительное предложение о работе, наткнулась на несколько таких, как ходить по домам и навязывать людям дешевые утюги за внушительную цену. Поиск работы оказался изматывающим, без посторонней помощи, я могла бы еще долго ходить по этим собеседованиям.</p>\n<h3>Неправильный подход может быть причиной неудачи</h3>\n<p>Мне повезло, отец работал в IT-компании. Он предложил меня в качестве подмены наборщикам, когда я еще училась, а когда закончила, помог получить работу по обновлению правовой системы на компьютерах у клиентов. Может быть меня взяли бы и, приди я с улицы, но для этого нужно было знать, куда идти. Через полгода я получила место в офисе в том же отделе обслуживания, а также начала играть с коллегами в волейбол. Это было здорово, знакомиться с людьми из других отделов, а еще на поле нет большой разницы между директором и аналитиком. Мне нравилось мое место и мои клиенты, но опять мне было «дружески» сказано, что без высшего образования, на большее я могу не рассчитывать.</p>\n<p>В это время я пыталась изучать PHP по книге. В начале все выглядело очень захватывающе, но функции без понимания как из них построить что-то целое не имели большого смысла, я пробовала, у меня не получалось, и в конце концов сдалась. Было сложно признаться, что я не смогла, даже самой себе и это неприятное чувство преследовало меня долгое время.</p>\n<p>Нужно было выбрать то, с чем я смогу справиться, что-то интересное и что будет мне по карману. Выбор пал на рекламу. В следующие 6 лет большая часть наших с мужем отпусков ушла на мои сессии. Ему было сложно выгнать меня из-за компьютера, я к нему приклеилась, поэтому он купил мне мой первый ноутбук. Английский по-прежнему давался мне очень трудно, и чтобы получить пять, пришлось переводить и запоминать вместе с транскрипцией все слова в учебном пособии. Снова я хотела то, что мне не давалось.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Я начала ненавидеть свое рабочее место задолго до того, как закончила университет с еще одним никому не нужным красным дипломом.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Я получила повышение достаточно скоро, несмотря на опасения, но затем руководство сменилось и работать с новым стало весьма напряженно. Я сбежала в декрет и провела следующие три года отпуска по уходу за ребенком полные сомнений. Учеба, рисование и приготовление пирогов отвлекали, но я оказалась не готова быть привязанной к коляске — ограниченной в передвижениях, оторванной от других людей, полагаться на деньги мужа. Возвращаться на работу я не хотела, но не видела лучшего выхода, была убеждена, и вполне резонно, что ни так много компаний готовы взять на офисную позицию женщину с маленьким ребенком и кучей больничных.</p>\n<p>После того, как я вернулась на работу, стало ясно, что ситуация стала еще хуже, чем была. Я потеряла свое место, а очередной новый руководитель относился во всем девушкам «поддержки» как к мебели. Несколько месяцев мне хватило.</p>\n<h3>Обратная сторона медали может быть золотой</h3>\n<p>Я хотела быть маркетологом. Зная, как непросто продавать что-то неосязаемое, решила работать с товаром, который можно пощупать. Сейчас думаю, разница была только в голове.</p>\n<p>Оказалось, сложно найти работу вне IT-сектора, некоторые менеджеры по персоналу снисходили для объяснений, что мне будет лучше в IT.</p>\n<p>И все-таки я была настроена оптимистично, я усердно училась и считала, что хорошо справляюсь, но опять, оказалось, что установила слишком низкую планку для работодателей. Компании, в которых я работала, хотели и публикации, и рост продаж исключительно за счет моей зарплаты. Ошибившись один раз, в следующий я специально уточнила вопрос с бюджетом, и меня заверили, что он есть. Оказалось, что это по-прежнему только зарплата. Это был период разочарований.</p>\n<p>Когда мне предложили административную работу на полставки с терпимым отношением к больничным, я с радостью ухватилась за возможность взять передышку. Работа была далеко от дома, и я проводила 2-3 часа в маршрутках каждый день в компании с аудиокнигами про Гарри Поттера. В этих дорожных пробках я наконец почувствовала английский язык и полюбила его, это дало мне свободу, которую невозможно купить за деньги. И, несмотря на долгую дорогу, я смогла играть после работы в волейбол с мужем и его коллегами. Жизнь налаживалась.</p>\n<p>Эта работа сама по себе, помимо низкой зарплаты, имела нечто ценное для меня – работающий сайт. После того, как мой начальник поссорился с разработчиком, я получила его на поддержку. Разобрав его на части, я поняла, как он работает. Это не был самый креативный сайт в мире, но он дал мне целостное представление, и я начала писать простые сайты с нуля.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Мой первый калькулятор на JavaScript практически свел меня с ума, но я продолжила.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Время от времени меня просили помочь родственники и друзья, обычно решить какую-то срочную проблему. Так я стала встречаться с популярными CMS. Одной из первых оказался WordPress. Там была проблема в теме, которую разработчик изменил и бросил. Я копала все выходные, но в конце концов нашла место, где код уходил в бесконечный цикл и исправила. Тогда для меня это была просто какая-то система…</p>\n<p>Два года спустя я все еще держалась за свою временную работу. Резкие манеры начальника перестали казаться забавными и последней каплей стало его категорическое заявление, что я не программист, потому что он не видел ничего, созданного мной. На тот момент я уже написала для сайта функционал, который он же просил, так что это было обидно. Я разозлилась и это стало толчком в нужном направлении.</p>\n<p>Я ушла, но все еще не пыталась получить работу разработчика, и в результате оказалась в одной из франшизных компаний, продающих сайты «из коробки». Это были сложные полгода с кучей работы, низкой зарплатой и провалами плана, закончившиеся воспалением легких. Сейчас, думаю, я оказывала клиентам медвежью услугу, сайт – не готовое блюдо для микроволновки, быстрое, дешевое и типовое. В этих сайтах нет жизни без вложения огромного труда, за которых никто не готов был платить. Большая часть сайтов умерли через год, но они и живыми то не были.</p>\n<h3>Нужно набраться смелости, чтобы повезло</h3>\n<p>Когда я поправилась, начала искать работу разработчика, но было сложно найти что-то подходящее даже просто чтобы решиться ответить на вакансию. В объявлениях были в основном представлены IT-компании, которым нужны гении, знающие огромное количество технологий и фреймворков. Только вид этих вакансий вгонял в депрессию.</p>\n<p>А потом мне снова повезло. Я открыла сайт частных объявлений и буквально сразу же нашла работу, которая мне подходила идеально — они хотели кого-то с опытом написания с нуля, умеющего разбираться и дописывать чужой код, переводить техническую документацию и статьи, а также делать простую полиграфию. Я сделала тестовое задание и была принята, ни дипломы, ни резюме уже не понадобились. Оказалось, это был объявление одного из отделов продаж в компании, занимающейся промышленным оборудованием, и я прошла в обход отделка кадров, который, уверена, даже не посмотрел бы на меня. Начальник согласился на мою работу удаленно, что решило проблему частых больничных, хотя ребенок рос, и их уже стало намного меньше. В дополнение к лучшей зарплате и спокойной работе без переработок и нервотрепки, мне достались замечательные коллеги. Мы дружим с тех пор, несмотря на то, что тогда никто не догадался позвать меня играть в волейбол.</p>\n<p>Это случилось через 14 лет после первоначального решения стать программистом и это был только начало. Я ушла через пару лет, когда ничего нового в работе уже не осталось.</p>\n<h3>Сознательные решения требуют широкий знаний</h3>\n<p>После того, как я поработала с разными CMS, смогла не только сравнить их между собой и понять, что WordPress лучшая из всех как для разработчиков, так и для клиентов, но также обнаружить, что вообще не видела хороших примеров разработки. Самая большая проблема WordPress — сделать так, чтобы работало, настолько легко, что мало кто не утруждает себя делать правильно, что позже оборачивается проблемами при доработке и поддержке. Впрочем, я видела плохие решения на разных CMS, да и сама их делала.</p>\n<p>Отталкиваясь от доступных примеров и документации и ища в поисковиках конкретные решения, я опять обнаружила, что не вижу всей картины. В этот момент курсы Udemy оказались очень кстати, а затем я начала посещать мероприятия WordPress, сначала онлайн, потом топая ни них ножками, оправляясь на поездах и самолетах, и обнаружила большое и весьма активное сообщество. Наконец-то я нашла не только тех, у кого можно спросить, но и как быть недалеко от тех, кто «в теме», насколько это вообще возможно. Самое важное – я нашла единомышленников, тех, кто не думает, что человек, говорящий с горящими глазами о работе, рехнулся, с кем у нас общая страсть и любовь к WordPress. Это то, что имеет значение.</p>\n<p>Сейчас, проработав 6 лет как разработчик, я все еще чувствую себя новичком, это бесконечное обучение, частые открытия, ошибки и непроходящее желание сделать лучше.</p>\n<h3>Смысл пути в самом пути</h3>\n<p>Мой путь очень извилистый, много метаний и набитых шишек, но для меня это как калейдоскоп, где каждый поворот показывает новую картинку, новое озарение, дает энергию двигаться дальше после казавшихся напрасными усилий. В периоды сомнений, я напоминаю себе о Дэвиде Огилви, который сменил множество специальностей, пока не добился успеха в рекламе.</p>\n<p>Я научилась не только сохранять лицо и идти вперед, но также набралась смелости.</p>\n<h3>Свобода — возможность принимать решения</h3>\n<p>Я ушла со своего последнего места работы, где мы закончили изматывающий двухлетний проект на другой CMS, ставший сам по себе большой ошибкой, и ни только приняла решение работать исключительно с WordPress, но и стать своим собственным начальником.</p>\n<p>Теперь я официально предприниматель. Все эти вещи «для больших мальчиков» выглядят достаточно сложными, но я больше не хочу слепо делать то, что мне скажут. В тренде коллаборации, куда ни глянь.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: 14 Years’ Detour\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=14%20Years%E2%80%99%20Detour&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2F14-years-detour%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: 14 Years’ Detour\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2F14-years-detour%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2F14-years-detour%2F&title=14+Years%E2%80%99+Detour\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: 14 Years’ Detour\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/14-years-detour/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/100219-150x150.jpg&description=14 Years’ Detour\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: 14 Years’ Detour\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/14-years-detour/\" title=\"14 Years’ Detour\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/14-years-detour/\">14 Years’ Detour</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 02 Oct 2019 05:00:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olga Gleckler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: Brian Gardner Steps Down From StudioPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94449\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://wptavern.com/brian-gardner-steps-down-from-studiopress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7190:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian Gardner <a href=\"https://studiopress.blog/not-goodbye/\">announced he was stepping down</a> from his role with StudioPress this past Friday.  Last year, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-studiopress\">WP Engine acquired StudioPress</a>.  After staying on board for the remainder of his contract, Gardner stepped down from his role with the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The past 15 months have gone by quickly, and it sometimes feels like yesterday that we made the announcement,&#8221; Gardner said in his post. &#8220;In the same breath, it has also felt like forever.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many in the WordPress community, Gardner needs no introduction.  He&#8217;s the founder of <a href=\"https://studiopress.com\">StudioPress</a> and co-created Genesis with Nathan Rice, one of the most popular WordPress themes today.  In many ways, he&#8217;s the father of the modern professional WordPress theme ecosystem, becoming one of the first theme authors to figure out that you could make a living by providing WordPress products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s unafraid of letting his personal geek flag fly in his online life. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bgardner/status/6776616143294464\">quotes Sarah McLachlan</a>, is a self-affirmed Starbucks addict, runs marathons, and loves family trips to Disney World.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many theme authors in the WordPress community, he&#8217;s an inspiration.  Even as a former business competitor, I&#8217;ve always admired his work.  More than that, I&#8217;ve admired how he runs his business.  He never needed to be flashy.  He never needed to create controversy for PR.  He, almost quietly, built up a successful company.  The splashes he made came from the products he and his company released.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2007, Gardner released the Revolution WordPress theme to the public for sale. Some may argue that Revolution was the catalyst for the commercial WordPress themes ecosystem.  There were several theme business startups around the same time.  Revolution at least played a pivotal role in the market&#8217;s early growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner launched the Revolution business in 2008, but quickly <a href=\"https://www.studiopress.com/revolution-rebrands-as-studiopress/\">rebranded to StudioPress</a> in 2009 after some legal issues with the name. By late 2010, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/studiopress-sold-to-copyblogger\">StudioPress merged with Copyblogger</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hindsight: The Biggest Regrets After 12 Years</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When building a successful company, it&#8217;s easy to look back on things that could&#8217;ve been handled differently.  There are deals passed up, ideas that flopped, and products that didn&#8217;t scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My biggest regret was not starting with (or switching to) a recurring business model,&#8221; said Gardner.  &#8220;I think I left a lot of money on the table by not doing that, but once I merged StudioPress into Copyblogger Media, we decided to leave it as is and use the former as a doorway into our company&#8217;s ecosystem.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many theme companies in the early days had lifetime sales.  It&#8217;s unlikely many could foretell how they&#8217;d need to scale for 10 or 20 years down the line.  The concept was relatively new in the WordPress space.  Gardner kept up with the model despite most theme shops moving to subscription-based sales, which typically scale better in the long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>From a personal standpoint, I think I could have done better. There were a few seasons (some short and others a bit longer) where I strayed away from my involvement at StudioPress. While I justified it by thinking that it was OK to pursue side projects and other things, I realize looking back that jeopardized the trust our customers had in the brand. I think I may have leaned too heavily on the fact that we had a team, but in the same breath, I think it was necessary for StudioPress to outgrow the label of &#8216;Brian Gardner themes.&#8217; This emphasis really helped with the transition after WP Engine acquired StudioPress.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Building a Community Over Software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Without a doubt, it&#8217;s the <a href=\"https://genesis.community/\">Genesis community</a>,&#8221; Gardner said when asked what he&#8217;s most proud of with his time at StudioPress. &#8220;When Nathan Rice and I set out to build Genesis (the framework), we were trying to solve a software problem and bring a better user experience for our customers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of building software, he learned what he was building was a community.  After creating a showcase page for people using the Genesis theme, he kept getting requests for people to build child themes.  This led to the creation of the <a href=\"https://www.studiopress.com/genesis-developers/\">Genesis Developers</a> page, which provided a way for people within the community to earn a living.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While community has always been important to me,&#8221; Gardner said, &#8220;I didn&#8217;t realize the ripple effect that creating a solid piece of software would have.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner said the developers page created a way to pay it forward to the people who had helped him build a successful company.  The idea has remained a success, and there are many designers within the larger WordPress community who list custom Genesis design work in their credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have had the pleasure of being able to meet and spend time with members of the community—from talking about their success to future plans,&#8221; said Gardner.  &#8220;This past year at WordCamp US in Nashville, I was able to fully comprehend the level in which lives had been changed by what we had done—and those are the moments I could not be any prouder of what I built.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s on the Horizon?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Heh. The million-dollar question, right?&#8221; responded Gardner to whether he plans to continue building themes.  He doesn&#8217;t have any plans to create a new theme business, and any themes that he does build will be built for Genesis and made available from his website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Over the past few years, I have developed a particular love for minimalist design, and I want to spend some of my time and creative energy there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gardner is currently available for hire as a website designer through <a href=\"https://authentik.com/\">Authentik</a>, a design and development studio that he founded.

The one-day conference drew 200 attendees and was the third in a series of Gatsby Days that have been held in other cities. They are designed to give the community an opportunity to meet in person and hear more about the future of the project from its creators and contributors.</p>\n<p>Gatsby creator Kyle Mathews gave the keynote address and described what he sees as a shift from the LAMP-stack CMS era to &#8220;content mesh&#8221; architecture.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Monolithic CMSs were invented in 90s — they’re now migrating to become specialized modular services,&#8221; Mathews said. Gatsby provides the presentation layer for this new architecture and its plugin layer connects out to multiple content sources.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Old world vs new world explained by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kylemathews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@kylemathews</a> shown in his diagram when explaining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@gatsbyjs</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GatsbyDaysLondon?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#GatsbyDaysLondon</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9EIxS6Sc3X\">pic.twitter.com/9EIxS6Sc3X</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Ilesh Mistry (@ileshmistry) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ileshmistry/status/1178598732000108544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 30, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>An informal survey of attendees showed that roughly a 1/3 were experienced at working with Gatsby and the majority of those in the audience were newer users or simply curious to learn more. Although Gatsby is currently geared primarily towards developers, Mathews described how the project is working towards enabling people in other roles who also work on websites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re thinking really hard about how we can help everyone who works on a website, not just developers,&#8221; Mathews said. &#8220;Right now, Gatsby is essentially for developers, but our goal isn&#8217;t to help developers per se. Our goal is to help amazing websites be created.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This matters because the world runs on websites. More and more essential services that everyone relies on are websites and web apps, and we want to help with that. Developers are a key part of building websites but the actual process of building a web property is an incredible cross functional job for an organization to take on.&#8221; This process often includes designers, content editors, marketing professionals, and others.</p>\n<p>Gatsby, Inc.&#8217;s first cloud service, <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.com/preview\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">CMS Preview</a>, was inspired by this goal of assisting non-developers who work on websites.

After no updates for nine months, Mark Warbinek, a frustrated user, contacted Automattic to ask if they have abandoned the plugin or still plan to update it. A support representative from Automattic <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/edit-flow-plugin-is-closed-no-longer-supported/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> the company will no longer be updating Edit Flow:</p>\n<blockquote><p>At this time there is no active development of the Edit Flow Plugin.</p>\n<p>That being the case – two things I can suggest are:</p>\n<p>Submitting the issue to the Github repository for the plugin.

It is still listed among the <a href=\"https://wpvip.com/plugins/edit-flow/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.com VIP plugins</a>, but will likely only be maintained for that platform going forward. <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/Edit-Flow/pull/499\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">A 10-month old PR</a> was merged on its GitHub repository as recently as 19 days ago, after the contributor began to question whether the project was abandoned.</p>\n<p>In 2016, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/hey-automattic-whats-going-on-with-edit-flow\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edit Flow went two years in between updates</a>, leaving frustrated users in the dark. After that incident, a representative from Automattic <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/hey-automattic-whats-going-on-with-edit-flow#comment-164215\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the company was working on an internal effort to improve the maintenance of their own plugins in order to avoid a situation like this happening again. The company currently has 88 plugins listed in the official directory.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/publishpress/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">PublishPress</a> is the only alternative editorial plugin with comparable features, including an editorial calendar, notifications, editorial comments, custom statuses, and a content overview. It also offers <a href=\"https://publishpress.com/knowledge-base/migrate/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">seamless migration of Edit Flow data to PublishPress</a>. A commercial version of the plugin includes additional features, such as a publishing checklist, reminders, permissions, a WooCommerce checklist, and more.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think I can speak for those users of this plugin that we are not happy with the horrible handling of this plugin, how Automattic has ignored and abandoned it, leaving users to suffer in the continuing fails this out-of-date plugin is causing,&#8221; Mark Warbinek <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/edit-flow-plugin-is-closed-no-longer-supported/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in response to to the reply from Automattic&#8217;s support team.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this is always a risk when using free plugins from WordPress.org, especially ones without a direct business model supporting development. In many instances the plugin author&#8217;s first priority will be maintaining it for the paying customers. In this case that is WordPress.com VIP clients. Automattic has not posted an announcement on Edit Flow&#8217;s support forums, but an official communication would go a long way towards steering users in the right direction when they inevitably come looking for signs of life in the plugin.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 01 Oct 2019 03:31:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.3 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=7262\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/09/wordpress-5-3-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2993:\"<p>WordPress 5.3 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend running it on a production site.

WordPress 5.3 will include versions 5.4 &#8211; 6.5 of the Gutenberg plugin, a total of 12 releases.  This makes for a lot of ground to cover.  The next release includes breaking changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For themes without custom block styles, little should change.  However, theme authors who have been building custom block designs will likely have some work to do if they haven&#8217;t kept up with the changes in the Gutenberg plugin over the past several months.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Style Variations API Introduced</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.3 introduces new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/24/new-block-apis-in-wordpress-5-3/\">server-side block style functions</a>.  This means that theme authors who prefer PHP can now register custom block style variations without writing JavaScript code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block styles feature allows theme authors to register custom styles for individual blocks.  Then, they must apply custom CSS to these styles in the editor and the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new functions are basic one-to-one matches to their JavaScript counterparts.  Block styles still need to be registered on a per-block basis.  Support for registering single styles to multiple blocks at once hasn&#8217;t landed in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Block HTML Creates Breaking Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite WordPress&#8217; commitment to backward compatibility over the years, the Gutenberg team hasn&#8217;t maintained that approach with blocks.  Block HTML output in the editor and the front end has changed for some blocks.  These changes will break custom theme styles in many cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following blocks have potential breaking changes for themes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Group:</strong> A new inner container element was added to the markup.</li><li><strong>Table:</strong> A wrapper element was added and the block class moved to the wrapper.</li><li><strong>Gallery:</strong> Like the table block, it received the same wrapper element treatment. Galleries also support a caption for the entire gallery block.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In my tests, the gallery block had the most obvious breaking changes. Depending on how it is styled, users could be looking at a single column of images instead of their selected number.  The core development blog has a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/27/block-editor-theme-related-updates-in-wordpress-5-3/\">complete overview of the HTML changes</a> along with code examples for addressing issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;d be interesting to see if the Gutenberg team makes similar HTML changes with other blocks in the future. Such changes make it tough for theme authors to maintain support between versions of WordPress and versions of the Gutenberg plugin.  It also bloats CSS code when attempting to maintain compatibility.  Adding an extra element doesn&#8217;t typically break things.  However, moving an element&#8217;s class to another element is a dumpster fire waiting to happen.  If these types of changes continue to happen, it could turn some theme authors away from supporting the block editor at a time when core needs to be encouraging more authors to design around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>New Block Classes Added</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Several <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/27/block-editor-theme-related-updates-in-wordpress-5-3/\">new CSS classes</a> are making their way into 5.3.  For themes that remove core block styles on the front end, they need to add support for the classes to their theme&#8217;s stylesheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is doing away with inline styles for left, right, and center text alignment. This is a welcome change because it moves CSS to its appropriate place, which is in a stylesheet.  Theme authors need to make sure they support these new classes for the following blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Heading</li><li>Paragraph</li><li>Quote</li><li>Verse</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The columns block no longer supports column-specific class names.  Version 5.3 supports custom column widths, which are handled with inline styles.  It&#8217;s unlikely this will break most themes, but it&#8217;s worth testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The separator block now supports custom colors.  It is given both the text and background color class names on the front end.  This allows theme authors to utilize the styling method they prefer.

Secure the News provides some interesting data in its campaign to encourage more broad HTTPS adoption.</p>\n<p>In 2018, after one year of collecting data on HTTPS encryption at more than 130 major world news sites, the project found that HTTPS was available on 2/3 of the sites it monitors (89 of 131), up from 1/3 in 2016. Approximately <a href=\"https://securethe.news/blog/how-secure-are-news-sites-report-first-year-secure-news/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">60% of news organizations offered HTTPS encryption by default in 2018</a> and that number is up to 93% today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-27-at-5.40.27-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Most of the WordPress-powered major news sites, such as <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ars Technica</a>, <a href=\"https://time.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Time</a> and the <a href=\"https://nypost.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">New York Post</a>, get a B ranking, with the exception of <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a> and <a href=\"https://qz.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Quartz</a>, which both scored an A.</p>\n<p>The most recent addition to the project is the ability to <a href=\"https://securethe.news/blog/introducing-regional-leaderboards-secure-news/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sort publications by region on the homepage</a>. Publications based in North America and Europe lead the world in having the most secure HTTPS implementations. Asia has a smaller percentage of major news sites with a score of A- or higher. Some smaller regions, such as the Middle East and North Africa, Oceana, and South America, list just a handful of news organizations but they all have a score of B or higher. Secure the News is just getting started with this feature and is accepting feedback on the project&#8217;s GitHub account.</p>\n<p>In addition to promoting HTTPS adoption, the team behind Secure the News is also considering broadening its coverage to measure other ways that news sites are delivering secure content, such as whether the site has an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">onion service</a>, is <a href=\"https://www.torproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tor project</a> friendly, or has a <a href=\"https://freedom.press/training/blog/first-time-they-reach-out-protect-sources-themselves/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">confidential tip line</a>.

I&#8217;d already been learning HTML and CSS for a couple of years.  I even had a home-brewed blog that pulled posts from plain text files at one point.  I knew enough JavaScript to do pop-up alerts and other annoying things that served no purpose and made for a poor user experience, even if they were fun for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was my second attempt at using WordPress.  This time it was after a botched go of making PHP Nuke behave how I wanted.  I had big dreams for my website but lacked the coding skills to make them happen.  WordPress was simple enough to hack for a novice like me at the time.  Sure, I broke my site more times than I could count, but I managed to put together my first real theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I popped open Photoshop; grabbed a few images from <em>Angel</em>, my favorite TV show at the time; and began my work.  I&#8217;d recently watched <em>Soul Purpose</em>, an episode that explored whether the titular character was truly the hero mentioned in an ancient prophecy.  It was foretold that the vampire with a soul would shed his demon half and live as a human.  It explored themes of the character&#8217;s place in the world.  At 21 years old, it&#8217;s the sort of episode that resonated with a young man who was also looking for his place.  I thought it fitting to work that into my theme&#8217;s design and began hacking away at a header for my theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Screenshot of my first WordPress theme header.</div>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, there was this loosely-connected underground of themers and hobbyists who were building WordPress themes based on their favorite TV series, movies, comic books, and more.  That was my first real introduction to WordPress.  These people were not building themes for profit.  They were searching for their place in this small corner of the internet.  At most, some were looking for validation from like-minded people who might enjoy their art.  It was about creation for the sake of creation.  Anyone could be an artist with a simple lesson in CSS, an image manipulation program, and enough grit to pour their soul into the project for a few hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there were ever a time that WordPress themes died, it was when the hobbyists who built for pure passion were overshadowed by business interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; business interests played a crucial role in propelling WordPress to become the most dominant CMS in the world.  However, the balance has clearly shifted in favor of building WordPress themes for business and ecommerce rather than for the enthusiasts who just want to create.  Other platforms have better catered to these users and filled in the gaps left open by WordPress.  Tumblr became a safe-haven for popular culture fans.  DeviantArt a home for artists.  Wattpad for aspiring writers and fanfic lovers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Somewhere along the way, we lost the innocence and artistry of building WordPress themes for the pure fun of it.  WordPress grew up and WordPress themes along with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Today&#8217;s Themes Are Not Tomorrow&#8217;s</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In his post, <a href=\"https://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2019/09/the-end-of-wordpress-themes-is-in-sight/\">The End of WordPress Themes is in Sight</a>, Ben Gillbanks said, &#8220;Themes as we know them will no longer be made.&#8221;  It is a bleak look at the future of WordPress theming.  He notes that he doesn&#8217;t believe that he&#8217;ll be able to make a living building WordPress themes in the next couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His worries are warranted.  They have been shared by several theme authors over the past couple of years as the block editor (Gutenberg) was making its way into core WordPress.  The official theme review team has discussed the team&#8217;s future role surrounding the coming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gillbanks&#8217; post comes on the heels of a post written by Matias Ventura on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/05/defining-content-block-areas/\">defining content block areas</a>.  Essentially, the idea is for WordPress to allow users to edit areas outside of the post content via the block editor.  Anything from the header, footer, sidebar, or otherwise would likely be fair game.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In such a system, themes would be relegated to defining block areas, providing base styles, and designing block output.  In many ways, this is what WordPress themes <em>should</em> be.  Some might say that WordPress is putting themes back into their proper place of simply styling content.  With the behemoth themes with hundreds or thousands of features we&#8217;ve seen over the past few years, this could be a welcome change.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s huge potential for designers to step up and make their mark.  I, for one, wouldn&#8217;t mind seeing CSS artists unleashed in the WordPress theme ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gillbanks went on to say:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>There are definite benefits to doing this from a user&#8217;s perspective – they will have full control of their site – but it&#8217;s going to result in some very boring website layouts.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the point where I&#8217;ll respectfully disagree.  Putting control in the hands of non-designers will be anything but boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Do we all so easily forget the days of GeoCities?</em>  The websites built from it may have been horribly inaccessible.  They may have blared midi files as soon as you opened a webpage.  They may have even had a flashing, scrolling marquee zipping across the header.  Boring is not the word I&#8217;d use to describe them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as many of us want to put those days behind us (Come on, you had one of those sites at one point, right? Tell the truth.), there was something fascinating about it all.  Real people built these sites because they were fun.  The sites told you something about that person.  It was a deeply personal look into this stranger&#8217;s world.  Sometimes it was just a bunch of junk spewed onto the screen, but most sites were a reflection of the site owners at that point in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was ugly and beautiful all the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web developers and designers joke about those dark days of the web.  It&#8217;s easy to look back at sites from the &#8217;90s and cringe at the silliness (It makes you wonder what designers of 2050 will think about today&#8217;s designs, doesn&#8217;t it?).  I choose to look fondly upon those days.  It was a time before I became a &#8220;designer&#8221; with rules to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, here&#8217;s the important point.  We are not the arbiters of the web.  It&#8217;s all about the user.  If someone wants a blinking Justin Bieber GIF in their site header, more power to them.  It&#8217;s the developer&#8217;s job to enable the user to do this in an easy-to-configure way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Wait?  So Geocities is your argument for full-site editing in WordPress?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding why WordPress should become a full-site editor means understanding the average user.  Developers are more apt to view things in a structured manner.  I spent over a decade honing my development skills.  Logic and order are old friends.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With end-users, things may seem a bit more chaotic.  A teenager might want to plaster a picture of her favorite band anywhere she wants on her site.  A soccer mom might want to show her kid slamming home the winning goal.  A poet may want to showcase one of his poems as a background image on his blog.  Humans are creative beings.  While our unique brand of artistry might not appeal to others, it&#8217;s still something we crave to share.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also important to understand that building WordPress themes is nowhere near as simple in 2019 as it was in 2005 when I started hacking away.  The code is much more complex.  It&#8217;s not quite as easy for a new user to piece together something fun as it once was.  Unless you have a theme or plugin that allows you to do this with simple drag-and-drop or similar tools, users have little control over their own sites.  And, that&#8217;s why the Gutenberg project is so revolutionary.  Its mission is to put the power back in the hands of the people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors need to evolve.  They will need to find a way to balance good design principles with the insane amount of freedom users will have.  There&#8217;s nothing stopping designers from making sure the Bieber screengrab looks more presentable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are WordPress Themes Dead?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No.  But, the theme landscape will certainly change and not for the first time.  We need not look at that as a bad thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those hobbyists who like to tinker with their site, they will once again have power that was so long ago lost to more advanced code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There will also be sub-communities within the WordPress landscape.  Some people will want something more akin to classic WordPress.  Others will want a simple blog handled with Markdown (side note: I&#8217;m one of those people, and Gutenberg actually handles pasting from Markdown well).  Plugins will be built to cater to every user&#8217;s needs.  Themes will exist for different types of users.  Client builds and enterprise solutions that look nothing like core WordPress aren&#8217;t going anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s still a long road ahead.  Theme authors need to be more involved with the development of Gutenberg as these features make their way into the plugin and eventually into WordPress.  Otherwise, they&#8217;ll risk losing the opportunity to help shape the future theme landscape.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truth be told, I&#8217;m not sure what themes will look like in a few years.  I have a horrible track record with predictions.  However, I think it&#8217;s safe to say that there&#8217;ll be a place for designers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m excited because I feel like it will bring back the potential for users to have the control they once had and more.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Sep 2019 18:56:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: Rich Reviews Plugin Discontinued after Vulnerabilities Exploited in the Wild\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94302\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:97:\"https://wptavern.com/rich-reviews-plugin-discontinued-after-vulnerabilities-exploited-in-the-wild\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3397:\"<p>After <a href=\"https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2019/09/rich-reviews-plugin-vulnerability-exploited-in-the-wild/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">tracking exploits of a zero day XSS vulnerability</a> in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/rich-reviews/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Rich Reviews plugin</a> for WordPress, Wordfence is recommending that users remove it from their websites.

CEO Kyle Mathews announced a <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2019-09-26-announcing-gatsby-15m-series-a-funding-round/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">$15M Series A funding round</a> today, just one year after creating the company with GatsbyJS core contributors. The open source Gatsby project started in 2015 to provide a framework for developers to quickly build websites with React. As the project soared in popularity, Mathews formed a company to fund its ongoing development and further invest in the growing Gatsby ecosystem of products.</p>\n<p>This round of funding will enable Gatsby to grow its 35-person team while investing in open source and cloud services that complement the company&#8217;s products.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With Gatsby, we’re striving to create a business model that will drive many millions of dollars of investment in open-source tools and enable people to build the next generation of web experiences,&#8221; Mathews said.</p>\n<p>At the forefront of the company&#8217;s vision is the idea of &#8220;reinventing website development.&#8221; Gatsby has popularized the concept of a “<a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/blog/2018-10-04-journey-to-the-content-mesh/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">content mesh</a>,” a platform that provides the infrastructure layer for a decoupled website and reimagines the role of a CMS within this architecture.</p>\n<p>Gatsby&#8217;s goal of creating more integrations for CMS&#8217;s was a big part of Mathews&#8217; funding announcement. Instead of writing off LAMP stack architecture as slow and obsolete, Gatsby is creating bridges to the CMS&#8217;s that power a large portion of the web:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Instead of a monolithic CMS powering everything, Gatsby ties together specialized services with a modern development experience and optimized website delivery.</p>\n<p>This content mesh empowers developers while preserving content creators’ workflows. It gives developers access to great cloud services without the pain of manual integration.</p>\n<p>Web developers from dozens of web CMS communities like WordPress and Drupal are going “headless” and using Gatsby as the presentation layer for their CMS.</p>\n<p>We’re forming partnerships with these communities to create seamless integrations between their solutions and Gatsby.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Gatsby will be using some of its funding to invest more heavily in the WordPress ecosystem. The company hired <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jason-bahl-joins-the-gatsby-team-to-work-on-wpgraphql-full-time\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">hiring Jason Bahl</a>, creator of the GraphQL for WordPress project, in June, and plans to add more WordPress developers.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We recently hired someone else to work alongside Jason in developing WPGraphQL (announcement coming soon!) and are currently hiring for several roles on the team,&#8221; Mathews told the Tavern.</p>\n<p>WordPress powers <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress/all/all\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">34.6% of the top 10 million websites</a> and Matt Mullenweg has previously estimated its ecosystem to be a $10 billion industry. The CMS is <a href=\"https://joost.blog/cms-market-share-a-numbers-analysis/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">showing no signs of decline</a>, and is a market that Gatsby product developers are strategically targeting.</p>\n<p>WordPress adopted React as its JavaScript framework in 2017, and built its new Gutenberg editor on top of it. Although some early adopters began digging deeper into React and creating their own products with it, the majority of PHP developers have been slow to move in that direction. Gatsby provides a bridge for those who are just getting started.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We think that for many web developers, a Gatsby project may be the first time they are using React, GraphQL, webpack or even Node.js,&#8221; Mathews said. &#8220;And that’s not just the case for WordPress developers &#8211; the same can be true for professionals in the Drupal, Rails, or .NET ecosystems.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s our goal to make a framework that empowers developers to use these technologies easily, then dive deeper as they gain more experience. So, instead of taking days to configure webpack for the first time, you can use a Gatsby Theme that connects to WordPress as a data source, and automatically get a blazing fast site. Later, you can learn the innards of the system, and begin customizing Gatsby yourself.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While Gatsby as a framework enables developers to bypass a lot of the technical and tooling jargon that has made modern development so complex, it is still a framework geared almost exclusively towards developers. Mathews said the company&#8217;s vision will continue to focus on enabling developers, not on creating solutions to make Gatsby more accessible to the non-technical crowd.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are focused on making Gatsby the best choice for WordPress developers who want a flexible and powerful presentation layer for their headless WordPress sites,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Non-technical team members or clients will still use WordPress to create and manage content, while the web developers on their team or at the agency they hired get to be productive using the best development tools available.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gatsby plans to use the funding to invest $3 million per year in open source, including the core Gatsby project, official plugins, and more learning materials. The funding is also good news for the future of the <a href=\"https://www.wpgraphql.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">WPGraphQL</a> project, which should see deeper integration with Gatsby in the near future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 22:35:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WPTavern: Long-Needed Date/Time Improvements Land in Core\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94295\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/long-needed-date-time-improvements-land-in-core\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4026:\"<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>After more than a year and several WordPress updates, an <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/23/date-time-improvements-wp-5-3/\">overhaul of the core Date/Time component</a> concluded.  WordPress 5.3 will ship with fixes for long-standing bugs and new API functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrey &#8220;Rarst&#8221; Savchenko spearheaded this project and worked through most of the issues in his <a href=\"https://github.com/Rarst/wp-date\">WP Date</a> fork of WordPress.  Much of his work toward addressing the problems with this core component goes back further with the initialization of his <a href=\"https://github.com/Rarst/wpdatetime\">WPDateTime project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Diving into the Date/Time component is no small feat.  Addressing one issue leads to another.  It&#8217;s a rabbit hole that few in the community have navigated.  Many developers were also unaware of the issues.  However, the bugs lingered for years, and users had no working solution for the problems they were facing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common errors were caused by core bugs or developer errors due to compatibility issues, described Savchenko.  This would cause user-facing issues such as post scheduling and other time-based operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the release of WordPress 5.3, all existing functions should behave more reliably.  Developers working on the component fixed several bugs and updated incorrect inline code documentation for many core functions. Along with the fixes, 5.3 will ship with new <a href=\"https://github.com/Rarst/wp-date/issues/4\">Date/Time API functions</a>.  The updated API includes unified time zone retrieval, localization, and PHP interoperability functions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savchenko called it &#8220;the slow descent into madness&#8221; when asked of the catalyst for diving into the Date/Time component and its underlying issues.  &#8220;I started to notice serious bugs in the component from WordPress Stack Exchange questions about them, and the more I looked over years the more clear the dire state of it became to me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the major problems is the way WordPress handles timestamps.  &#8220;I actually had to invent the &#8216;WordPress timestamp&#8217; term,&#8221; said Savchenko.  &#8220;There was no name for it in core development and inline documentation incorrectly called these Unix timestamps before.&#8221;  WordPress adds a time zone offset to the real Unix timestamp, which causes issues with upstream PHP and external systems.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress timestamps couldn&#8217;t be removed from core without breaking backward compatibility.  Plugin and theme developers should avoid working with the WordPress timestamp and opt to use the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/09/23/date-time-improvements-wp-5-3/\">recommended methods</a> outlined in Savchenko&#8217;s post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress date functions were originally written in PHP 4, a version of PHP so long-dead that it&#8217;s almost not worth digging up the end-of-life date (it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.php.net/eol.php\">11 years</a>, by the way).  PHP 5.2 introduced the PHP <code>DateTime</code> and <code>DateTimeZone</code> classes and has continued receiving improvements over the years.  WordPress date functions were never updated to utilize newer standards.  The platform&#8217;s more recent bump to a minimum of PHP 5.6 also meant that the <code>DateTimeImmutable</code> class introduced in PHP 5.5 would be available.  The version bump helped land the new API functions in WordPress 5.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some bugs go as far back as 7 years, such as <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/20973\">shorthand formats not working with the core date_i18n() function</a>, which was fixed in WordPress 5.1.  With any luck, core may also adopt such features as <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18146\">user-based timezones</a> in the future, which would better handle time differences on WordPress installs with users all over the world.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 16:33:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Gary: Talking with WP&amp;UP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:25:\"https://pento.net/?p=5120\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"https://pento.net/2019/09/26/talking-with-wpup/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:348:\"<p>At WordCamp Europe this year, I had the opportunity to chat with the folks at WP&amp;UP, who are doing wonderful work providing mental health support in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpandup.org/podcast/getting-to-the-core-of-wordpress-021/\">Listen to the podcast</a>, and check out the services that WP&amp;UP provide!</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Sep 2019 04:35:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Gary\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 5.0.0 Release Candidate 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=308016\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://buddypress.org/2019/09/buddypress-5-0-0-release-candidate-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2087:\"<p>Hi!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/buddypress.5.0.0-RC2.zip\">The second release candidate for BuddyPress 5.0.0</a> is now available for an ultimate round of testing!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2019/09/buddypress-5-0-0-release-candidate/\">first release candidate</a>, we&#8217;ve improved the way BP REST API Controllers are loaded inside BuddyPress component classes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone as we progress toward the BuddyPress 5.0.0 final release date. &#8220;Release Candidate&#8221; means that we think the new version is ready for release, but with more than 200,000 active installs, hundreds of BuddyPress plugins and Thousands of WordPress themes, it’s possible something was missed.

Organizers also recommend creating a CONTRIBUTING.md file with contribution guidelines and adopting a code of conduct for the project.</p>\n<p>Adding WordPress to a search for Hacktoberfest issues displays <a href=\"https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=label%3Ahacktoberfest+state%3Aopen+wordpress&type=Issues&ref=advsearch&l=&l=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">120 issues</a> that are related in some way to themes, plugins, apps, and other products with WordPress-specific needs. The event is a good opportunity for maintainers to get more exposure for their projects and help new contributors gain confidence through a structured contribution process.</p>\n<p>This year Hacktoberfest&#8217;s organizers are also featuring <a href=\"https://github.com/topics/climate-change\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">projects focused on combating climate change</a>. These include repos for open source technologies, such as an <a href=\"https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/ClimateChangeProjections\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">embeddable map that shows climate change projections</a>, an <a href=\"https://github.com/juancoob/Vegginner\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">app targeting consumption habits</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/sphericalpm/ghgdata\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">greenhouse gas emissions data packaged for exploration and charting</a>, to name a few.</p>\n<p>Hacktoberfest is open to contributors at any level of experience. For those just getting started, DigitalOcean has created an <a href=\"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/an-introduction-to-open-source\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Introduction to Open Source</a> series that covers the basics of git and how to create a pull request. DEV also has a <a href=\"https://dev.to/tvanblargan/crash-course-git-lingo-1enj\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Git crash course</a> available to get new contributors up to speed.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Sep 2019 22:39:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: Human Made Releases Publication Checklist Plugin Designed for the Block Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=94238\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://wptavern.com/human-made-releases-publication-checklist-plugin-designed-for-the-block-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2502:\"<p>Human Made has created a <a href=\"https://github.com/humanmade/publication-checklist/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Publication Checklist</a> plugin built specifically for the block editor. It was developed as a headline feature of <a href=\"https://humanmade.com/2019/06/17/a-technical-introduction-to-altis-enterprise-augmented-wordpress-platform/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Altis</a>, the company&#8217;s enterprise publishing platform based on WordPress, but is also available as a standalone plugin that developers can customize for their own particular use cases.</p>\n<p>Ryan McCue, Human Made&#8217;s Director of Engineering, shared screenshots of the plugin on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rmccue/status/1173550662296190976\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> but noted that it may require more manual configuration when used outside of Altis. Developers familiar with React can extend the checklist to provide a more interactive experience for users completing the required publishing tasks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Because this is built for the block editor, you can build the UI for your checks in React, allowing users to fix issues inline, or providing richer interaction; e.g. &#8216;jump to block failing this check,\'&#8221; McCue said.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Screen-Shot-2019-09-25-at-10.43.20-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Status of the publishing tasks is also shown in its own column in the posts list table, a useful feature for giving editorial teams a better overall picture of posts in progress. (The plugin also provides a way to disable this view.)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/publication-checklist-posts-list-table.jpeg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the Publication Checklist plugin only provides a framework for the pre-publish checks, and does not include a settings interface for users to create their own checks. For this reason, the current version is more geared towards developers who are capable of registering checks using the provided function. The checks display a warning if incomplete but users are still allowed to publish. A more strict enforcement that blocks publishing can also be applied.

It combines plant derived digestive enzymes with three top quality probiotic strains proven to confer health benefits:</p>\n <p><strong>L. Acidophilus DDS-1, L. Bulgaricus DDS-14 and Bifidobacterium Bifidum</strong>.</p>\n <p>Taken with food this formula ensures complete, comfortable digestion; no more reflux, bloating or constipation. Taken on an empty stomach and at a different time from a meal the enzymes are absorbed into the circulation where they help the energy release from fat cells.</p>\n <h2>Some general information on probiotics</h2>\n <p>Good probiotics are able to safely and effectively:</p>\n <p><strong>1) Treat Digestive Problems</strong><br />\n Constipation, diarrhoea, gas, bloating, and symptoms of IBS are some of the most common gastrointestinal complaints that can be effectively and safely treated with good probiotics.<br />\n <br />\n <strong>2) Suppress Bad Bacteria<br />\n </strong>A safer and more effective way of eliminating bad bacteria in the body is by overpowering them with good bacteria. </p>\n <p><strong>3) Produce </strong><strong>Natural Antibiotic Substances</strong><br />\n<a href=\"http://www.drshahaniprobiotics.com/htmls/l_acidophilus_dds-1.html\">L. Acidophilus DDS-1</a> has been shown to produce the natural antibiotic substance Acidophilin that kills pathogenic bacteria.</p>\n <p><strong>4) Inhibit Tumors and Carcinogenesis</strong><strong> </strong><br />\n In clinical studies, <a href=\"http://www.drshahaniprobiotics.com/htmls/l_acidophilus_dds-1.html\">L. Acidophilus DDS-1</a><u>and <u>L. Bulgaricus</u> have been shown to inhibit tumor growth and block the formation of carcinogenic compounds in the colon.</p>\n <p><strong>5) Conquer Yeast and Fungal Infections</strong><br />\n Diets rich in sugar, cortisone and cortisone-like drugs, birth control pills, immunosuppressive drugs and antibiotics, are major culprits in the &quot;candida epidemic&quot; of today. Studies show the ability of probiotics to stimulate the production of white blood cells in the body that combat candida yeast and fungal infections.</p>\n <p><strong>6) Enhance Calcium Metabolism</strong><br />\n In clinical studies, <a href=\"http://www.drshahaniprobiotics.com/htmls/l_acidophilus_dds-1.html\">L. acidophilus DDS-1</a> has been shown to increase the body\'s ability to absorb and metabolise calcium. This is an incredible advantage for individuals suffering from bone density loss such as osteoporosis and osteopenia.  This is also of great benefit for growing young adults and expectant mothers who need lots of calcium.</p>\n <p><strong>7) Improve Immune Function</strong><br />\n As the intestine is the <strong>body\'s largest immune system organ</strong>, its ability to efficiently respond to immune attacks is directly related to its balance of healthy bacteria. Regular probiotic supplementation has been shown to maintain intestinal health and enhance natural immune system response by stimulating the body\'s production of NK- and T-cells.</p>\n <p><strong>8) Improve Blood Cholesterol Profiles</strong></p>\n <p>Studies show that <a href=\"http://www.drshahaniprobiotics.com/htmls/l_acidophilus_dds-1.html\">L. Acidophilus DDS-1</a> is a proven aid in the digestion of fats that contribute to the levels of LDL and HDL cholesterol in the blood.</p>\n <p><strong>9) Produce B Vitamins</strong><br />\n<u>L. Acidophilus DDS-1</u> has been shown to produce B vitamins, which support and increase the rate of metabolism, help maintain healthy skin and muscle tone, and enhance nervous system <font size=\"2\">function and Folic Acid, which is essential especially for expectant mothers.</p>\n <p><strong>10) Reduce Skin Problems</strong><br />\n Help alleviate skin problems such as acne, psoriasis, and eczema.</p>\n <p><strong>11) Support Liver Function</strong><br />\n By helping to detoxify the blood, <strong>B. Bifidum </strong>and other probiotics help the liver to perform more efficiently.</p>\n <p><strong>Background info to the Stanford University study</strong></p>\n <p>The trial involved 44 patients who underwent gastric bypass surgery and were randomly assigned to receive either 2.4 billion lactobacilli daily or no probiotic therapy for the next 6 months. Quality of life, hydrogen (H2) breath tests, vitamin B12 levels and weight were measured before surgery and after 3 and 6 months.</p>\n <p>At six months, the probiotic group had lower H2 breath tests, lower fasting insulin, lipoprotein A and triglyceride levels, and higher HDL cholesterol levels compared with the placebo group and they had shed more weight. Although the differences were not statistically significant, there was a significantly greater improvement in quality of life for the patients taking probiotics compared to the placebo group.</p>\n <p><strong>References</strong></p>\n <p>1) <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/healthNewsMolt/idUKCOL27173520080522?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true\"><font color=\"#000000\">http://uk.reuters.com/article/healthNewsMolt/idUKCOL27173520080522?pageNumber=2&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true</font></a></p>\n <p>2) Membrez M., et al. in FASEB Journal 22, 2008</p>\n <p>3) Inderst, R., Systemic Enzyme Therapy, in Journal of Pharmacy, 52 (1992), Lomax J.E., Lipoplasty, Winter 1998-99, Desser L., Rehberger A., Oncology, 1990, 47;474.</p>\n <p><strong>Start by removing chemicals from your diet, your skin care and your body</strong><br />\n Organic food, or food that has not been sprayed with pesticides, will reduce the number of pollutants in the body.</p>\n <p>Skin care products without chemical ingredients will enhance your outer green as well.<br />\n Avoid products derived from <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/petroleum.html\">petroleum</a>, such as mineral oil, and petroleum jelly.

The unconditional love he displays contrasts with the obsessive sexual emotions in films such as Basic Instinct or the romantic love portrayed by Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman in the epic Australia.</p>\n <p>In the real world, however, unconditional love is often experienced towards people with whom there is no connection. The question is: why? To carry out the study, Beauregard recruited subjects with a proven ability to feel strong unconditional love: low-paid assistants looking after people with learning difficulties. Beauregard asked them to evoke feelings of unconditional love and hold them in their minds while they had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.</p>\n <p>Of the seven brain areas that became active, three were similar to those of romantic love.

The new study confirmed this trend over the long term.</p>\n<p>&quot;Metformin does ... induce <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/vitamin_B12.html\">vitamin B12</a> malabsorption, which may increase the <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/risk.html\">risk</a> of developing vitamin B12 <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/deficiency.html\">deficiency</a> -- a clinically important and treatable condition,&quot; the researchers wrote.</p>\n<p>The researchers assigned 390 <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/Type_2_diabetes.html\">Type 2 diabetes</a> patients at the outpatient clinics of three nonacademic hospitals to take either metformin or a <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/placebo.html\">placebo</a> pill three times per day for more than four years. The average study participant had been diagnosed with diabetes 13 years prior and had been undergoing <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/insulin.html\">insulin</a> treatment for seven years. Average participant age was 61.</p>\n<p>Among those taking metformin, vitamin B12 levels began to steadily drop relative to those who were taking a placebo pill. The biggest drop occurred in the first few months, but the decrease continued over the course of the study.</p>\n<p>After four years, participants in the metformin group had undergone a 19 percent relative reduction in their levels of the nutrient. They were 11.2 percent more likely than placebo participants to suffer from B12 insufficiency and 7.2 percent more likely to suffer from deficiency.</p>\n<p>For every 8.9 patients treated with metformin, one would develop insufficient vitamin B12 levels. This increased risk remained after researchers adjusted for other risk factors including age, duration of diabetes, insulin dose, sex, smoking status and previous treatment with metformin.</p>\n<p>&quot;Our study shows that it is reasonable to assume harm will eventually occur in some patients with metformin-induced low vitamin B12 levels,&quot; the researchers wrote.</p>\n<p>The researchers found that metformin seems to inhibit the intestine\'s absorption of vitamin B12. Fortunately, calcium supplements appear to reverse this effect.</p>\n<p>Vitamin B12 is critical for maintaining nerve and red blood cell health. It can be found in animal products, nutritional yeast and fortified breakfast cereals. Symptoms of deficiency include anemia, fatigue, nerve damage and cognitive changes. Because similar <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/symptoms.html\">symptoms</a> often occur in diabetics and the elderly, deficiency may be hard to detect in such populations. Yet while B12 deficiency can carry severe consequences, it is relatively easy to correct with supplementation.</p>\n<p>The researchers suggested that all patients taking metformin have their vitamin B12 levels tested regularly to avoid potentially severe consequences.</p>\n<p>&quot;Vitamin B-12 deficiency is preventable; therefore, our findings suggest that regular measurement of <a href=\"http://www.naturalnews.com/vitamin_B-12.html\">vitamin B-12</a> concentrations during long-term metformin treatment should be strongly considered.&quot; the researchers wrote.</p>\n<p>Nearly 11 percent of the U.S. population, or 24 million people, suffer from diabetes.

It tends to run a chronic and unremitting course and often leads to the development of alcoholism and depression. The disorder most often surfaces in adolescence or early adulthood, but it can occur at any time, including childhood.</p>\n<p>Using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), researchers in The Netherlands were able to detect biochemical differences in the brains of individuals with generalized social anxiety disorder (also known as social phobia), providing evidence of a long-suspected biological cause for the dysfunction.</p>\n<p>The study compared densities of elements of the serotonin and dopamine neurotransmitter systems in the brains of 12 people diagnosed with social anxiety disorder, but who had not taken medication to treat it, and a control group of 12 healthy people who were matched by sex and age.</p>\n<p>Both groups were injected with a radioactive compound that binds with elements of the brain&rsquo;s serotonin and dopamine systems. Once administered, the radiotracer revealed functional alterations in these systems by measuring the radioactive binding in the thalamus, midbrain and pons (known to be acted upon by serotonin) and in the striatum (known to be acted upon by dopamine). The altered uptake activity in these regions indicated a greater level of disordered function.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Our study provides direct evidence for the involvement of the brain&rsquo;s dopaminergic system in social anxiety disorder in patients who had no prior exposure to medication,&rdquo; said Dr. van der Wee, M.D., Ph.D., at the department of psychiatry and the Leiden Institute for Brain and Cognition at the Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden (and previously at the Rudolf Magnus Institute of Neuroscience, University Medical Center in Utrecht, The Netherlands). &ldquo;It demonstrates that social anxiety has a physical, brain dependent component.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Serotonin and dopamine (neurotransmitters, or substances responsible for transferring signals from one neuron to another) act upon receptors in the brain. If the neurotransmitters are out of balance, messages cannot get through the brain properly. This can alter the way the brain reacts to normal social situations, leading to anxiety.</p>\n<p>Other neuroimaging studies have shown abnormalities in glucose and oxygen consumption in the brain, according to van der Wee, who also points to causality as an additional issue. &ldquo;Most of the people involved in these earlier studies were known to be already suffering from the disorder, so we do not know if the abnormalities were present before the onset of the disorder,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n<p>Based on earlier studies, some researchers have suggested that social anxiety disorder is a result of the interplay between a genetic or acquired biological vulnerability and environment. More recent research has indicated that social anxiety disorder might be related to an imbalance of the neurotransmitter serotonin. This is the first time the brain&rsquo;s dopaminergic system was examined directly.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;Although there are no direct implications for treatment as a result of this study yet, it is another piece of evidence showing biological abnormalities, which may lead to new therapeutic approaches and insight into the origins of the disorder,&rdquo; said Dr. van der Wee.</p>\n<p>Co-authors of &ldquo;Increased Serotonin and Dopamine Transporter Binding in Psychotropic Medication-Na&iuml;ve Patients With Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder Shown by 123-I-&beta;-(4-Iodophenyl)-Tropane SPECT&rdquo; include J.

Your amygdala might not be getting the right amount of dopamine, according to <a href=\"http://www.citeulike.org/user/nelmor/article/3655646\">a recent study</a> led by German researchers. The findings suggest a new approach to anxiety disorders, which are <a href=\"http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/the-numbers-count-mental-disorders-in-america.shtml#Anxiety\">said to affect</a> nearly 20 percent of adults in the United States. The dopamine connection might also help to explain why excess anxiety has been linked to Parkinson&rsquo;s disease and other conditions involving disruptions of the brain&rsquo;s dopamine circuitry.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;One can imagine in the distant future the development of a drug that selectively enhances dopamine signaling in the amygdala, leading to decreased anxiety,&rdquo; says Ahmad Hariri, a neuroimaging expert at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine who participated in the study.</p>\n<p>The amygdala is an almond-shaped structure nestled in both the left and right temporal lobes. Much remains to be learned about its various subregions and functions, but it seems to have evolved largely to help animals connect the events and situations of life with appropriate emotional reactions.</p>\n<p>Although the amygdala appears to be involved in processing positive emotions, it is better known for its role in processing fearful and anxious emotional states associated with potential threats to survival. Animals whose amygdalas are experimentally damaged often lose their usual caution in the presence of strangers, even predators. In the classic demonstration, a rat whose amygdala has been removed will calmly approach even a sleeping cat. Humans with damaged amygdalas also show a blunted ability to react to things in the environment that would normally produce an emotional reaction.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, excess anxiety doesn&rsquo;t appear to be caused simply by a hyperactive amygdala. Recent research has suggested that problems in the way the prefrontal cortex and other brain regions respond to the amygdala&rsquo;s activation may be more important.</p>\n<p>&ldquo;In simple terms, the amygdala is working to let you know that there&rsquo;s something out there that may or may not be important for your survival,&rdquo; says Hariri, &ldquo;whereas the prefrontal cortex, once stimulated by the amygdala and also receiving feedback from your autonomic responses, is charged with determining what the best course of action is and, in doing so, quieting the amygdala.&rdquo; </p>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.citeulike.org/user/nelmor/article/3655646\">the recent study</a>, published Nov. 2 in <i>Nature Neuroscience,</i> a group including Hariri and led by Thomas Kienast at the Charite Hospital in Berlin decided to look at how this amygdala&ndash;prefrontal cortex network is affected by the neurotransmitter dopamine. Nerve circuits originating in the midbrain are known to provide inputs of dopamine to the amygdala. As elsewhere in the brain, this dopamine signal appears to indicate the importance or &ldquo;saliency&rdquo; of a given event. The researchers wondered whether the levels of dopamine ready to be pumped from these nerve terminals inside the amygdala would help to determine how well the amygdala and prefrontal cortex communicate.</p>\n<p>To find out, they first used <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positron_emission_tomography\">positron emission tomography</a> (PET) with a radioactive dopamine-like tracer to measure storage levels of the neurotransmitter in the amygdalas of 13 adult male volunteers. Then, using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging\">functional magnetic resonance imaging</a> (fMRI), they studied changes in the activity of the amygdala, and a linked prefrontal region called the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), when the same volunteers were shown a standard set of emotion-evoking images.</p>\n<p>Kienast and his colleagues found that those with greater dopamine stores in the left amygdala&mdash;which seems to represent fear more reliably than the right amygdala&mdash;also tended to show greater and better ACC-linked left-amygdala responses in fMRI scans. Those with less amygdala-ACC integration were more likely to score higher on a psychological test for &ldquo;trait anxiety&rdquo;&mdash;the baseline anxiety level that comes with one&rsquo;s personality.</p>\n<p>In other words, says Hariri, &ldquo;as the functional coupling between these brain regions increases, in part reflecting dopamine&rsquo;s boosting effects on amygdala reactivity, the general tendency to experience events in your life as more stressful and anxiety-provoking decreases.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>Dopamine storage capacity in the amygdala is just one thing that can influence anxiety levels, Hairiri emphasizes, and more research is needed to spell out this and other influences.</p>\n<p>However, such research could some day broadly affect our understanding of anxiety. In one recent study, for example, Japanese researchers found that dopamine storage in the amygdala and related regions declines with age, which raises the possibility that aging itself might disrupt the brain&rsquo;s ability to process emotional states appropriately, including controlling excess anxiety. Other researchers have noted a strong <a href=\"http://pmj.bmj.com/cgi/content/abstract/77/904/89\">association</a> between anxiety and Parkinson&rsquo;s disease&mdash;in which the supply of dopamine to some brain regions is lost. Kienast and some of his colleagues from the present study also published a <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/30/8080\">paper</a> in 2007 showing, among other things, an association between reduced dopamine storage in the amygdala and worse symptoms in people with schizophrenia.</p>\n<p>Anxiety also is common in drug-addiction withdrawal, notes <a href=\"http://www.scripps.edu/research/faculty.php?rec_id=685\">George Koob</a>, an expert on the neurobiology of addiction at the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif. For example, Koob says, &ldquo;binging on cocaine may ultimately lead to more and more anxiety-like responses that persist into protracted abstinence.&rdquo; The findings of Kienast, Hariri and colleagues are consistent with the idea that drug-induced disruptions of dopamine signaling can bring about such long-term shifts towards greater anxiety, Koob adds.</p>','anxiety social phobia','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 12:48:25','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=351',0,'post','',0),(353,2,'2011-02-15 12:49:59','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<p>We can move towards wholeness by choosing wisely and creating healthy habits, which have the potential to be more powerful and transformative than our genetic programming or heredity.</p>\n<p>&quot;Doctors prescribe drugs, of which they know little, to cure diseases, of which they know less, for people, of whom they know nothing.&quot;</p>\n<p>Voltaire</p>','creating health','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 12:49:59','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=353',0,'post','',0),(355,2,'2011-02-15 12:55:55','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<p>To be healthy is to be whole, which means having our body, mind and emotions integrated.

Alcohol boosts levels of dopamine, hence the popularity of social drinking. No surprise then, that for the treatment of <a title=\"What is Depression? What Causes Depression?\" href=\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/8933.php\">depression</a>, interest is growing in dopamine as a therapeutic target - at least according to presentations at \'Beyond Serotonin - The Science of Neurotransmitters\' a workshop held at the recent European College of Neuropsychopharmacology (ECNP) congress held in Amsterdam.</p>\n<p>&quot;Dopamine is the neurotransmitter associated with the \'pleasure system\' of the brain. It provides feelings of enjoyment and reinforcement to motivate us to continue certain activities,&quot; said Professor Stuart A Montgomery, Emeritus Professor of Psychiatry, Imperial College School of Medicine, London.</p>\n<p>&quot;Dopamine was originally known as the \'reward chemical\' because it is released during rewarding activities such as food and sex - this neurotransmitter is primarily involved in regulation of attention, motivation, pleasure, and reward. Lack of dopamine is associated with decreased ability for experience pleasure, decreased motivation, decreased attention and cognitive slowing,&quot; he added.</p>\n<p>According to Dr George Papakostas, Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School, USA, dopamine has largely been ignored as a target for pharmacotherapy in major depressive disorder, a situation he finds surprising.</p>\n<p>&quot;Very few agents with dopamine activity have been developed to date. Pro-dopaminergic agents represent a potential for treatment breakthrough for major depressive disorder,&quot; said Professor Papakostas. &quot;Furthermore,&quot; he added, &quot;Agents with prodopaminergic activity may possess efficacy and tolerability advantages over traditional 5HT-selective agents.&quot;</p>\n<h3>New trials</h3>\n<p>One of the few dopaminergic agents to be developed, the noradrenaline-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) bupropion hydrochloride has been available in United States (but not Europe) for major depressive disorder since 1989. GlaxoSmithKline is currently conducting clinical trials with the extended release formation (Bupropion XL) and is planning to file an application in Europe to market bupropion XL for major depressive disorder.</p>\n<p>According to Dr Papakostas, clinical studies reported at the ECNP indicate that bupropion XL given once-daily could be an important option for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder.</p>\n<p>The studies show that bupropion XL is effective and well tolerated for depressed patients who present with core symptoms of decreased pleasure, energy and interest. Additional data presented at the meeting also show bupropion XL has similar efficacy to escitalopram, a newer-generation selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), in treating adults with major depressive disorder, also known as depression.</p>\n<p>&quot;Furthermore, while shown to be as effective as the SSRI escitalopram, treatment with bupropion XL does not appear to be associated with sexual side effects or sedation that patients often experience during treatment with the SSRIs,&quot; said Dr Papakostas.</p>\n<p>&quot;Such adverse effects often have a significant and negative impact on patient\'s quality of life, psychosocial functioning, as well as long-term compliance with treatment.&quot;</p>\n<p>In a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, investigators evaluated the efficacy of bupropion XL 300 to 450 mg per day in 274 adult outpatients with major depression characterised by loss of pleasure, interest and energy for eight weeks.</p>\n<p>Patients were enrolled in the study with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) diagnosis of major depression and Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS) score of seven on the general interest, energy, pleasure, sexual interest and physical energy items. Investigators used IDS-Self Report (IDS-SR) and IDS-Clinician Rated (IDS-C) questionnaires to assess each subject\'s change in depressive symptoms during the study. </p>\n<p>Patients taking bupropion XL (n=135) had a statistically significantly greater improvement in both the IDS-SR and IDS-C total score compared to patients on placebo (n=139) at week 8 (p=.018 and p&lt;.001, respectively).</p>\n<p>Patients treated with bupropion XL reported significant improvement at the end of the first week of treatment. Patients in the bupropion XL arm had a 41 percent remission rate, or subsiding of depressive symptoms, compared to a 27 percent remission rate for patients on placebo (p=.01, bupropion versus placebo).</p>\n<p>&quot;Low energy, lack of interest or poor interest, and the inability to experience pleasure are core symptoms of depression that are not always completely alleviated by existing treatments and; thus, can continue to impair patients\' functioning, and prolong patient suffering,&quot; said Dr. Papakostas. &quot;The data presented demonstrate that bupropion XL is well tolerated and effective in alleviating these particular depressive symptoms.&quot;</p>\n<h3>Two classes compared</h3>\n<p>The efficacy of two antidepressants from different classes - bupropion XL, an NDRI that acts on noradrenaline and dopamine, and escitalopram, an SSRI that affects serotonin - was examined in patients with moderate to severe major depressive disorder in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Investigators randomised 424 adult outpatients to receive either bupropion XL 300-450 mg per day, escitalopram 10-20 mg per day or placebo for eight weeks.</p>\n<p>Over the study period, efficacy was evaluated on a weekly or biweekly basis using the investigator-rated Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a self-evaluation completed by study participants.</p>\n<p>Patients treated with bupropion XL (n=138) and escitalopram (n=149) achieved a mean difference from baseline HAMD-17 score (Week 8) of 0.94 (95% CI -0.7, 2.6) demonstrating comparable efficacy between the two treatments. On the HADS, bupropion XL and escitalopram patients showed similar total score mean improvements from baseline(-11.0 versus -11.5, respectively).</p>\n<p>Patient response to treatment (responder rate), subsiding of their depressive symptoms (remission rate) and mean change in severity of their depression scores (global severity scores) were similar for patients on bupropion XL and escitalopram. With the exception of escitalopram\'s negative impact on sexual function, both bupropion XL and escitalopram were well tolerated.</p>\n<p>Written by: <br />\n  Ian Mason<br />\n  <a href=\"mailto:ianmason@ntlworld.com\">ianmason@ntlworld.com</a></p>','to be','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 12:55:55','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=355',0,'post','',0),(357,2,'2011-02-15 12:56:13','2011-02-15 11:56:13','<p><b>Major depressive disorder</b> (<b>MDD</b>) (also known as <b>recurrent depressive disorder</b>, <b>clinical depression</b>, <b>major depression</b>, <b>unipolar depression</b>, or <b>unipolar disorder</b>) is a <a title=\"Mental disorder\" href=\"/wiki/Mental_disorder\"><font color=\"#0645ad\">mental disorder</font></a> characterized by an all-encompassing <a title=\"Depression (mood)\" href=\"/wiki/Depression_(mood)\"><font color=\"#0645ad\">low mood</font></a> accompanied by low <a title=\"Self-esteem\" href=\"/wiki/Self-esteem\"><font color=\"#0645ad\">self-esteem</font></a>, and by <a title=\"Anhedonia\" href=\"/wiki/Anhedonia\"><font color=\"#0645ad\">loss of interest or pleasure</font></a> in normally enjoyable activities.

Scientists have found that obese rats had lower levels of dopamine D2 receptors than lean rats and that when food intake was restricted the number of D2 receptors increases.</p>\n<p>This research follows brain-imaging studies that also found decreased levels of dopamine D2 receptors in obese people compared with normal-weight people reported in the journal &quot;Synapse&quot; in 2007.</p>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/photos/2007/THANOS_one_month-300.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"autoradiograms\" src=\"http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/photos/2007/THANOS_one_month-w.jpg\" /></a>\n<p class=\"caption\">Autoradiograms showing dopamine D2 receptor levels in the brains of genetically obese and normal lean rats at one month of age who had been given free access to food since birth.

At one month, obese rats had fewer receptors (less red) than lean rats.</p>\n\n <p>The finding that food restriction can attenuate the effects of aging on the brain\'s ability to respond to dopamine may also help explain why food restriction slows down other changes associated with aging, such as declines in locomotor activity and sensitivity to reward.</p>\n<h3>Study methods and main findings</h3>\n<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/photos/2007/THANOS_four_months-300.jpg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><img border=\"0\" alt=\"Autoradiograms\" src=\"http://www.bnl.gov/bnlweb/pubaf/pr/photos/2007/THANOS_four_months-w.jpg\" /></a>\n<p class=\"caption\">Autoradiograms showing dopamine D2 receptor levels in the brains of obese and lean rats at four months of age. Half of the rats had been given unrestricted access to food during the previous three months while the other half were kept on a restricted diet. Compared with the images at one month of age (above), these images show that the number of dopamine receptors declined with age in both obese and lean rats, but significantly less so for animals on a restricted diet than for those given unrestricted access to food. This effect of food restriction was most apparent in the obese rats.</p>\n\n <p>The researchers measured dopamine D2 receptor levels in adolescent and young adult genetically obese Zucker rats and lean rats. Between measures, half of the rats in each group were given free access to food while the other half were given 70 percent of the daily average amount of food eaten by the unrestricted group.</p>\n <p>The scientists measured D2 receptor levels using two different techniques: micro-positron emission tomography (<a href=\"http://www.bnl.gov/CTN/microPET.asp\">microPET</a>) in living animals, which uses a radioactively tagged molecule that competes with the brain\'s natural dopamine for D2 receptor binding sites, and autoradiography, which uses a tracer that binds more strongly than natural dopamine but can only be used in tissue samples rather than in living animals. Together these two methods indicate the absolute number of D2 receptors found in the brain and how many are available or free during day-to-day function, which might be relevant to further elucidating the role of dopamine in obesity.</p>\n <p>One main finding was that the overall number of D2 receptors was lower in obese than in lean rats. Also D2 receptor levels decreased with age, but this decline was significantly blunted in food-restricted rats compared with those given free access to food. This attenuation was most apparent in the obese rats.</p>\n <p>Another main finding was that D2 receptor availability - that is, the number of receptors available for binding dopamine - was greater at adulthood in the obese rats compared to the lean rats. This suggests that perhaps the release of dopamine had significantly decreased with age in the obese unrestricted animals more than in the restricted ones or the lean rats.

Moreover, it is also well known that the level of leukocytes in the blood stream rises after a meal. This is due to the fact that leukocytes are rich in enzymes, mainly amylase, but also protease and lipase, which they use to carry out their immune activities. However, when digestive enzymes are lacking, leukocytes stop working as immune agents and provide their enzymes to the digestive process. It is for this reason that we are much more vulnerable to viral attacks and infections immediately after a meal. <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">Generally, digestive enzyme deficiencies severely impair our immune system over time</span>.</p>\n <p>The same is also true of immune stress produced by <b>intense physical activities</b>. It has been proven that athletes who take enzyme supplements before physical activity produce much lower quantities of lymphocytes.<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>In summary, the supplementation of Aspergillus-derived digestive enzymes not only shows beneficial and direct effects on digestion but has powerful indirect effects on immune function thereby halting the vicious circle whereby the lack of enzymes in ingested food causes considerable stress on the pancreas and, concomitantly a reduction in its immune functions. These immune functions are further impaired by undigested macromolecules, which are the result of poor digestion. In turn, this phenomenon also increases pancreatic stress and thereby pancreatic immune and digestive functions; and so forth &hellip;</p>\n <p>The Aspergillus fungus enzymes contained in <span style=\"font-weight: bold\">VITALZYM</span> are the most effective to be found since they are wide-ranging and work at human body temperature. They function in environments ranging from pH 3.0 to pH 9.0, which makes them the only enzymes that are active in the acidic, basic and neutral tracts of the intestine. In this regard, it should be pointed out that Pepsin and Trypsin only work in the acid environment of the stomach while pancreatic enzymes are only active in the alkaline pH of the small intestine. More specifically, Aspergillus enzymes are only deactivated rather than destroyed after they have passed through the acidic tract. Further on, in the alkaline environment of the small intestine they are reactivated and contribute to the completion of the digestive process. Based on studies performed by Dr. Edward Howell, Aspergillus enzyme supplements self-digest food, breaking down up to 50% of carbohydrates, 30% of proteins, and more than 10% of fats.

More recently I have been involved in working with children aged 3 to 4 years in a local nursery school, a project established by a progressive Head teacher who opened a \'healing\' room in her school. Here, children could relax, listen to stories, practise massage with their Mums who themselves could attend courses about health and childcare.</p>\n\n <p>My introduction to the nursery began when I taught a Holistic Health class there - a course based on Louise L. Hay\'s \'Heal Thyself\', which examines the emotional issues behind physical problems. This philosophy reflects that of Dr Edward Bach and his 38 flower essences, which when used alone, or together, apply to every possible mix of emotions.</p>\n <p>On learning about the essences some of the parents asked if they might try them to help their children with behavioural problems such as shyness, etc., The subsequent success of this small trial led to the head teacher allocating some of her budget to fund a low cost clinic where parents could access treatment and pay a minimal fee if they could afford it. </p>\n <p>Soon, both the staff and parents observed remarkable changes in the children with behavioural problems such as agresssion or temper tantrums. It was very clear that the flower essences were making a tremendous difference, so much so, that in one case a child with suspected <strong>Asperger\'s Syndrome</strong>* was given the confidence to interact with other children. Her various fears, which included; using any toilet other than home, watching certain TV programmes, not being able to sleep alone, travelling by train or bus - were all overcome. However, the biggest step was her ability to start primary school and mix with new children without the trauma normally associated with this syndrome.</p>\n <p>A selection of essences were used at different stages; <strong>Aspen </strong>for irrational fears, <strong>Rock Rose </strong>for the terror she often showed e.g., screaming when taken onto a train/bus, <strong>Impatiens </strong>because she was always busy and wanted immediate attention, and <strong>Vine </strong>because she liked things done her way only. <strong>Crab </strong><strong>Apple </strong>was also added to this regimen at a later stage, as it appeared she showed fastidiousness about using different toilets. <strong>Walnut </strong>was also given before she was due to start her new school.</p>\n <p>This child may need to continue taking the essences for a while to support her during her journey through school, but for her Mum, the improvement to her daughter\'s emotional balance means that her school life is normal and her daughter is fitting in and coping.</p>\n <p>I have listed a few of the more interesting cases below to show the variety of problems that the essences have helped. All the children\'s names have been changed in the following cases. </p>\n <p><strong>Jack aged 4</strong></p>\n <p>Jack was one of the greatest successes at this clinic and was the very first child treated. Jack\'s behaviour was such that he had been placed on the register for <strong>Emotional and Behavioural difficulties (EBD).</strong> His behaviour both at home and nursery was disruptive. After discussion with the Head teacher, his Mother decided to try the flower essences. Jack was hyperactive, his mind going all the time, he would not give in to tiredness, was anxious about any change, showed anger and impatience with his family and other children and teachers at the school.</p>\n <p>The first essences given were: <strong>White chestnut </strong>for his active mind, <strong>Walnut </strong>to help him move forward and accept a new school, <strong>Oak </strong>for pushing himself even when exhausted and <strong>Vervain</strong>, because he was over enthusiastic about everything he did and <strong>Impatiens </strong>for his irritation with everyone. Jack took the essences for two months, before attending his new school. By this time <strong>he had been taken off the EBD register</strong>.</p>\n <p><strong>Sally aged 3</strong></p>\n <p>Sally refused to interact with other children, she would cover her work with her hands if staff approached her, and would not answer teachers if they spoke to her. After some discussion with the Mother and the Head teacher it became apparent that Sally was manipulating the situation, in that she would respond at home but not in nursery. The Mother was becoming very upset and worried about her behaviour, saying Sally was very timid and shy. After great thought I decided to try the <strong>Vine </strong>essence for the manipulation.This seemed quite a strong remedy for such a little tot, but taking into  consideration the staff comments about her manipulation and the Mother\'s concern that Sally was shy, I decided that the combination of <strong>Mimulus </strong>and <strong>Vine - t</strong>wo very different &quot;personality&quot; types, yet very much part of Sally\'s personality could yield results. This approach had an immediate effect - to the amazement of the staff! A week later the Head called to say, &quot;Sally actually spoke to us today!&quot;.</p>\n <p>One very obvious problem at nursery schools is that young children are unable, or unwilling to &quot;poop&quot; and from discussions with medical staff, it is clear that this common problem often results in children as young as three years, undergoing a bowel wash. The following two cases serve to demonstrate how the gentle, yet powerful flower essences can avoid the need for this invasive procedure.</p>\n <p><strong>Mary aged 3</strong></p>\n <p>Mary would use the toilet to empty her bladder but insisted on wearing a nappy to empty her bowel. Her Mother was concerned as Mary was soon to commence nursery so she decided to try the flower essences. As with most of the children, because they cannot explain their emotions, I have to listen to their parents and teachers and attempt to understand the child\'s feelings and thoughts. I decided to try:-</p>\n <p><strong>Larch - </strong>as it seemed she might lack confidence</p>\n <p><strong>Mimulus</strong> - for her fear of using the toilet</p>\n <p><strong>Chestnut bud - </strong>as she had previously had an accident with diarrhoea while staying with her grandmother and may be afraid of this happening again if not wearing a nappy</p>\n <p><strong>Star of Bethlehem -</strong> because I felt that this or some other incident had left Mary shocked and afraid to try and use the toilet for bowel movements</p>\n <p>One week later Mary was using the toilet without a problem.</p>\n <p><strong>Jenny aged 3</strong></p>\n <p>Jenny was about to undergo treatment at hospital for a bowel wash, because she would or could not, empty her bowel. She had been prescribed with Lactulose and Senna without success and so her Mother decided to try the essences before the hospital treatment. Again, with little to go on, I decided to try the &quot;fear&quot; essences and gave Jenny <strong>Mimulus </strong>and <strong>Rock Rose. </strong>I also added <strong>Vine</strong>, as she appeared to be a very  determined little girl who did things her way.</p>\n <p>Within a short time Jenny was going to the toilet naturally and the bowel wash procedure was avoided.</p>\n <p style=\"text-align:center;\">~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>\n <p>These are only a few of the children who have been helped by the flower essences. We tend to forget that young children suffer from upsetting emotions, just as we adults do, but as they have little experience in knowing how to deal with their emotions, they quite often display aggressive behaviour.</p>\n <p>Another common situation is when there is an addition of a new baby to the family.

A recent study performed at the University of Urbino, Italy, using Klamath algae and Phycoplus® (an extract from the algae) confirmed this lipid lowering effect along with a significant reduction in lipid oxidation - the basis of cardiovascular/hepatic diseases and cell ageing (2).\n\n<strong>Hypoglycaemia, Diabetes and Obesity - </strong>AFA has been proven to inhibit the pancreatic production of alpha-amylase, thereby decreasing excessive glycaemic levels and to partially inhibit the intestinal activity of two enzymes, sucrase and maltase, which are responsible for the assimilation of sugars into the bloodstream. Together these findings show how AFA can contribute to the resolution of the famed Syndrome X, that combination of excessive glycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia which is at the root of today\'s metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, diabetes and obesity (3).\n\n<strong>NB Loss of control of blood fats and sugar causes rapid physical and mental ageing! </strong>\n\n<strong>Stress, Anxiety and Depression - </strong>Disorders such as depression, anxiety and attention deficit disorders figure prominently in the retrospective study mentioned above. Until recently, Klamath algae\'s ability to improve stress and nervous conditions was attributed to its general nutritional properties. But it has been discovered that Klamath algae, if processed using the Refractance Window Method®, contains a significant amount of phenylethylamine (PEA), a brain amino acid directly responsible for increasing the activation and transmission of important neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine. Supplementation with 10-60mg of PEA was able to cure 60% of clinically diagnosed depressions (4). Klamath algae, and especially a specific algae extract-Phycoplus®, contain enough PEA to promote better mood, relieve stress and anxiety, help with moderate to serious depressions, and possibly solve problematic yet still not clearly diagnosed conditions such as ADD/ADHD (5). Indeed, PEA has been named the \"molecule of love\" due to its increased endogenous production in states such as intense concentration, joyful activities and love (6).\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">References</span>\n\n1.

Hence, the blood supply (at rest), to the GI tract is <strong>greater than any other resting organ system in the body</strong>.\n\nThis rapid cell turnover means that the GI tract particularly sensitive to any nutrient deficiencies in the diet as well as any stresses which have the same nutrient depleting effect by starving the lining of its blood supply.\n\nWhen the lining cells are no longer replaced effectively, digestive health begins to be compromised. Our entire health is then put at risk as nutrients are less effectively absorbed and the lining cells suffer even more. The downward spiral has begun! It is at this stage that we can become more sensitive to environmental toxins and undigested proteins and increasingly susceptible to invading organisms and even our own emotional responses.\n\nIf the repair mechanisms worsen, a loss of integrity of the barrier function can occur creating the condition known as \"<strong>leaky gut syndrome</strong>\". Partially digested food, toxic chemicals, whole bacteria, viruses and parasites are then able to enter the bloodstream.\n\nOnce in the circulation these substances are recognised as being “foreign” by the body, provoking an increase in the number of white blood cells (leucocytes) in the circulation. Circulating Immune Complexes are then formed as these blood cells attempt to neutralise the foreign substance. If the lining of the GI tract is not quickly repaired, the production of leucocytes becomes excessive and chronic, invariably causing inflammation locally in the GI tract or elsewhere in the body.\n\nMany chronic auto-immune conditions are caused by these immunological reactions, as the raised level of circulating antibodies mistakenly attacks our own tissues.\n\n<strong>Friendly helpers</strong>\n\nA healthy GI tract is home to approximately 10<sup>14</sup> \'friendly\' bacterial cells of more than 500 species weighing approximately 1.35 kg. Beavering away inside, they contribute to our health by secreting important compounds such as butyric acid, vitamins and natural antibiotics, which prevent the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria. They also digest certain foods and support the body\'s immune function. Generally, friendly bacteria maintain an intestinal environment that promotes healthy intestinal mucosa (2). However, they too are also easily disturbed by a poor diet, illness, or any emotional or physical stress or trauma (including surgery), <strong>and can be wiped out completely by antibiotics.</strong>\n\n<strong>True protectors</strong>\n\nThe distal part of the GI tract, which is home to the majority of these bacteria, used to be considered almost as an appendage of the digestive tract, whose principal purpose was the conservation of salt and water, and the disposal of waste materials. However it is now recognised that the metabolic potential of the human colonic microflora is impressive in terms of the number of biochemical reactions and transformations in which it participates. Bacteria play a key role in numerous processes in the large bowel, including carbohydrate and protein fermentation, bile acid and steroid transformations, metabolism of xenobiotic substances, development of the immune system, as well as the activation and destruction of potential mutagenic metabolites (3).\n\nHealthy microbiota also play an important role in stimulating colonic motility and decreasing transit time-therefore reducing the opportunity for fermentation and the production of pathogenic catabolites by potentially pathogenic micro-organisms.\n\nIndeed, the GI bacterial flora exert their many effects mainly through catabolic pathways. For example, in exchange for the supply of complex carbohydrates (starches and non-starch polysaccharides) from the host, intestinal bacteria produce butyrate, a bacterial fermentation product and principal source of energy for epithelial cells in the distal bowel.\n\n<strong>The role of probiotics </strong>\n\nToday\'s Western diet (high in fat, sugar, salt and low in vegetable fibres, minerals such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, and chromium, Omega-3 fatty acids, membrane lipids, vitamins and antioxidants) has been shown to predispose humans to inflammatory, infectious, ulcerative, degenerative and neoplastic diseases. Such diets show a <strong>virtual absence of beneficial bacteria</strong>. Called probiotic, because they are literally \'for life\', these beneficial bacteria are part of naturally preserved foods such as sauerkraut, yoghurt, and kefir. A probiotic can be best defined as a live microbial food supplement that beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance.\n\nMost organisms studied in this respect are lactic acid producers, namely the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, which stand out as being essential not only for the functionality of the intestines but also for the reinforcement of the natural defence of the whole body. Human and animal studies <em>in vivo</em>, as well as numerous clinical studies, indicate that intestinal flora positively affect many organ systems distant from the gut. Similarly an overgrowth of the wrong bacteria, which may establish themselves after a course of antibiotics can provoke disease states far away from the gut, for example:\n<ul>\n	<li>Arthritis: For reasons not fully understood, the wrong bacteria in the digestive system can cause or worsen arthritis. This ailment is strongly associated with GI problems such as colitis, coeliac and Crohn\'s disease.</li>\n	<li>Hyperactivity and Autism: These conditions have been linked with toxins in the gut produced by harmful bacteria.</li>\n	<li>Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s diseases: research suggests that an overload of these gut toxins may be responsible for the destruction of brain and nerve cells.</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>To encourage the growth of friendly bacteria:</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>avoid sugar to prevent yeast overgrowth in the colon</li>\n	<li>regularly consume insoluble fibre from corn and wheat bran to feed the good bacteria</li>\n	<li>avoid alcohol and antibiotics</li>\n	<li>minimise stress as much as possible.</li>\n</ul>\nHowever there is no substitute for the use of <strong><span>high-quality probiotic supplements</span></strong>. Just about everyone, even those who do not have GI problems will benefit from their anti-ageing, disease fighting effects. Potency and purity are especially important when choosing a brand since the bacteria are, after all, alive.\n\n<strong>For a probiotic to be effective it must</strong>:\n<ul>\n	<li>retain potency during storage</li>\n	<li>survive passage through acid and bile mediums</li>\n	<li>attach to the intestinal walls and proliferate well</li>\n	<li>compete with any pathogenic bacteria present</li>\n	<li>produce B group vitamins and enzymes</li>\n	<li>stimulate a beneficial immune response</li>\n</ul>\nMany products currently marketed claim some or all of these properties but on testing, <strong>some 70-90% regularly fail to comply</strong> with even their own claims. Either the strain declared on the label is not the one actually present, or it is mixed with other strains; a problem which is often coupled with the further negative fact that the actual bacterial count on average is significantly lower than that declared.\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to select probiotic strains based on the ability of the manufacturer both to guarantee their actual nomenclature and adopt biotechnological and/or other methods to enhance stability and activity over time.\n\nThe most reliable, commercially available strain to guarantee a strong stability over time at room temperature, together with correct nomenclature and high count, is the <strong>Lactobacillus acidophilus strain DDS-1</strong>, manufactured according to the proprietary methodology developed by Prof. Shahani at the University of Nebraska (4).\n\n<strong>Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1</strong>\n\nThe ability to stimulate a primary immune response in the gut is one of the main benefits of a good probiotic, and is strictly associated with the contribution that such a probiotic can make against pathologies such as allergies, inflammatory conditions, diarrhoea and even cancer. Diarrhoea is a pathology that involves both a bacterial and a virus infection, and probiotics that can both produce natural antibiotics and can stimulate an immune-based anti-viral response are indeed very effective in different types of diarrhoea, from children to adults and travellers.\n\nDifferent types of human strain probiotics have been shown to be active against diarrhoea (5). L.acidophilus DDS-1 is known to produce the powerful natural antibiotic \"acidophilin\" , which has been shown to strongly inhibit at least 23 pathogenic bacteria, including streptococci, salmonella, staphylococci, pseudomonas, proteus, shigella and E.coli, one of the major culprits of diarrhoea (6). Given also its ability to stimulate a local immune response, L.acidophilus DDS-1 has indeed all the requirements and has been repeatedly proven to be a powerful tool against diarrhoea as well as other bacterial and viral infections (7). DDS-1\'s immunological proerties extend also into the very important area of tumor prevention and treatment. It does this by preventing the transformation of nitrates and nitrites into nitrosamines and has been repeatedly proven to inhibit tumor cell proliferation up to 41% in vivo! (8)\n\nDDS-1 also has the ability to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood (9). It has been proven to produce higher levels of lactase and beta-galactosidase enzymes than most other lactobacilli, thus proposing itself an important addition in the treatment of lactose intolerance .\n\nFind L.acidophilus DDS-1 in <strong><a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalshape\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">vitalSHAPE</a></strong>\n\n<strong>REFERENCES</strong>\n\n1.

Its positive neurological effects can potentially be explained by its rich nutritional profile providing all the nutrients required for good health: 14 vitamins, 28 minerals, omega 3 and 6 fatty acids, 20 amino acids, particularly those acting as precursors to the neuropeptides; phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine. Recently however, research is focussing on a <strong>specific neuroregenerative molecule, phenylethylamine </strong>(PEA) &ndash; otherwise known as the &quot;love molecule&quot; present at significant concentration in the algae. </p>\n <p>PEA is the neuro-hormone our body produces when we fall in love or when we experience happiness, joy and calm and significantly, <strong>people who are depressed have low levels</strong>. PEA is an important neurotransmitter involved in a variety of pathways in the brain and, taken orally, has been shown to; alleviate depression, stabilise mood, improve mental acuity, and stimulate feelings of joy and love (1, 2). In addition, PEA directly contributes to raising the quantity of <strong>freely circulating dopamine</strong>, thereby improving executive functions such as motivation, concentration and memory.</p>\n <p>It\'s no coincidence that people crave chocolate when they feel blue, for chocolate contains small quantities of PEA. </p>\n <p>The beauty of this Primordial food is that it is suitable for the young and old alike as well as pregnant and breastfeeding women. Indeed, Klamath is often recommended to pregnant and lactating women who need extra protein and iron.  </p>\n <p>Topping up PEA levels is a safe way to help depressed people see the lighter side of life and gives them the nourishement they need to feel motivated again&quot;.</p>\n <p><strong>References</strong></p>\n <p>1.

The article suggested this product could help with Restless Legs Syndrome by increasing the level of dopamine – a neurotransmitter in the brain that, among other things, is responsible for the co-ordination and control of movement.  Published research studies link low levels of dopamine with RLS.  </p>\n <p>Lesley was at her wits\' end so decided to give vitalMAX a try.  Within a month her RLS was significantly reduced.  </p>\n <p>Lesley\'s mother, 77, has suffered from RLS for nearly 10 years.  Her condition was more pronounced than Lesley\'s to the point where she started to worry and panic when sitting in confined spaces.  Long car journeys, a trip to the cinema and a leisurely meal were all out of the question.  Not to mention the fact she never slept well.  Again, her GP in Reading could offer no advice.  Having enjoyed the benefits of vitalMAX Lesley introduced her mum to it – and her symptoms have cleared completely!  This has made a huge difference to her.  As an active grandma with three daughters and seven grandchildren, her life has been enhanced greatly by solving this problem.</p>\n <p>&quot;RLS is very uncomfortable and you can\'t control it at all,&quot; says Lesley.  &quot;I admit it sounds stupid and other people can\'t understand what it feels like.  But they certainly get annoyed if you\'re sitting near them when it kicks off!</p>\n <p>&quot;Trying to sit still is the hardest thing and some nights it was almost impossible to get to sleep – or stay asleep.  It really did affect my lifestyle and it was such a relief to find vitalMAX.  Finally I can sit still, relax, sleep well – and take the family to see a long film at the cinema.&quot;</p>\n <p>Lesley takes two capsules each day and this holds her RLS in check.  She did run out of the supplement once and within a couple of days her RLS was back to full force.  As soon as she took vitalMAX it calmed back down again.</p>\n <p>In addition, Lesley reports feeling really well on vitalMAX.  She used to suffer from colds and minor illnesses but since taking it she hasn\'t suffered at all.  And now she feels much happier in herself.  Previously, her mood was a lot lower for much of the time.  All these benefits are not surprising as vitalMAX is a powerful nourishing tonic for both the mind and body. In particular it has a high concentration of phenylethylamine (PEA) – a neurohormone known as the \'love molecule\' since it is the molecule we produce when we feel love, joy and calm. PEA is able to lift depressions and improve mood and concentration: as it has proved with Lesley.</p>\n <p>&quot;I confess when Mum started to suffer from RLS I used to think \'what\'s she on about?\'&quot;, admits Lesley. &quot;Having suffered too, it\'s no laughing matter and is, in fact, very challenging to live with.  I\'m so pleased to have found vitalMAX and to be able to help my mum too.  She lives in Reading – a good five hour car journey away.  You can imagine how difficult it was to see each other with us both suffering with RLS.  Everything is so much improved now.&quot;</p>\n <p><strong>About vitalMAX</strong></p>\n <p>vitalMAX consists of pure organic Klamath blue-green algae potentiated with Phycoplus® an exclusive concentrate of <strong>phenylethylamine and phycocyanins </strong>from the algae and with Vegimineral 77, a natural organic mineral source.  To date, Klamath AFA Fresh is the only known food to contain <strong>significant quantities of PEA </strong>and this <strong>concentrated supply </strong>found in vitalMAX increases the freely circulating level of dopamine in the brain to produce many favourable effects including the relief of Restless Legs Syndrome.</p>\n <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>\n <p>1. Klamath blue-green is the only source of nutrition to contain the full range of amino acids, fatty acids (omega-3 and 6), minerals and oligo-elements needed to keep the human body in perfect synergy. Klamath BG is also a primary source of anti-oxidants and chlorophyll, which cleanse and detoxify the body.  Simply Vital Ltd uses Klamath blue-green AFA Fresh®, farmed from Upper Klamath Lake and dried using the exclusive Refractance Window Technology®, a method which preserves up to 10 times more nutrients than older methods such as spray/freeze drying.</p>\n <p>2. To date, Klamath is the only food known to contain significant quantities of phenylethylamine, an amino acid that is naturally produced by our brain during states of love and joy (to such an extent that it has been called the &quot;love molecule&quot;). Phenylethylamine directly contributes to increasing the quantity of freely circulating dopamine, thereby increasing dopaminergic transmission. That is why PEA is known for its ability to alleviate depression (1), stabilise mood, improve mental acuity, and stimulate feelings of joy and love (2). PhycoPlus® concentrates the PEA naturally found in Klamath to allow it to produce important nutritional-therapeutic effects in cases of depression, mood swings, memory, concentration and mental acuity problems (including Alzheimer\'s disease) (3) and attention deficit and learning disorders (4).</p>\n <p>3. Phycocyanins have powerful <strong>anti-oxidant </strong>properties, <strong>significantly more than vitamins C and E</strong>, especially against OH and RO free radicals (5, 6). Their exceptional anti-oxidant ability directly inhibits the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme and, consequently, the production of <strong>leukotriene B4 (LTB4)</strong>, which is responsible for a number of different inflammatory conditions in the body (7).</p>\n <p><strong>References</strong></p>\n <p>1.

Magnesium has fallen by 10% and 25% respectively for these two food groups and in just the last 20 years there has been huge losses of vitamins and minerals from our fruits and vegetables e.g. </p>\n <p>\n <table width=\"450\" border=\"0\">\n  <tr>\n    <td><strong>Banana</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>Potato</strong></td>\n    <td><strong>Spinach</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>phosphorus &ndash;84%</td>\n    <td>calcium &ndash;70%</td>\n    <td>magnesium &ndash;68%</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n    <td>vitamin B6 -92%</td>\n    <td>magnesium &ndash;33%</td>\n    <td>vitamin B6 &ndash;59%</td>\n  </tr>\n</table>\n</p>\n <p>These nutrient reductions, which are the result of intensive farming methods which rob the soils of essential nutrients, come at at time when we are bombarded by a myriad of chemical pollutants in our environment and our food. These petroleum by-products, pesticides, hormones and antibiotics have all been shown to be harmful to our health.</p>\n <p><strong>Are Synthetic Supplements the Answer?</strong><br />\nThe results from an important five year study performed by Oxford University with more than 20,000 people were reported in 2002. After supplementing daily with; 600mg vitamin E, 250mg vitamin C and 20mg beta-carotene, it was observed that <strong>no beneficial preventative effect</strong> to cardiovascular pathologies occurred (1).  And in a separate equally important study, it was shown that taking isolated beta-carotene, a powerful anti-oxidant, actually <strong>causes more</strong>, not less, cellular oxidation (2).</p>\n <p>Seems not then! </p>\n <p>But the challenge remains: how can we ensure we are receiving the nourishment we need, while minimising the calories we consume.</p>\n <p>The answer is to eat nutrient dense foods such as the edible blue-green algaes and seaweeds.</p>\n <p><font size=\"2\">This challenge is met perfectly by </font>Nature\'s first food - Klamath blue-green algae (Aphanizomenon flos- aquae or AFA for short), the <strong>most nutrient abundant food source on our planet! </strong></p>\n<p>AFA - contains a bounty of vital nutrients and is one of the last remaining sources of wild nutrition available in commercially significant quantities.</p>\n <p>Blue-green algae are the oldest life form on the planet and laid the foundation of the earth\'s ecosystems. Ancient civilisations: the Egyptians, Aztecs, Chinese and Ethiopians ate it to supplement their diets and modern day consumers have benefited from its exceptional qualities for more than 30 years.  However, it is only quite recently that research has revealed its full nutritional and nutraceutical potential for healing.</p>\n <p>Klamath algae is a blue-green, freshwater algae. It differs from other micro-algae such as Chlorella and Spirulina, insofar as it grows wild in an optimal environment allowing it to develop a truly remarkable nutritional profile. That environment is Upper Klamath Lake in southern Oregon, one of the most pristine ecosystems remaining in North America. The lake is constantly replenished by snow and water runoff from one of the most highly active volcanic regions in the world. This unique source of pure rich mineral water together with a great opportunity for photosynthesis (300 days of sun per year) and cold winters that allow the algae to produce important essential fatty acids, create this nutrient abundant food source.</p>\n <p><strong>AFA contains over 70 nutrients in an organic, highly absorbable form:</strong> <strong>28 Minerals and oligoelements</strong> - Klamath algae is the only food to contain the full range of minerals and trace elements needed to keep the human body fully functional.</p>\n <p><strong>14 Vitamins</strong> - the complete and balanced spectrum.  It is an excellent source of B vitamins, guaranteeing over 200% RDA of the increasingly elusive B12, in just 1 gram!  (3).</p>\n <p><strong>20 Amino Acids</strong> - including all the essential ones in a proportion almost identical to that considered ideal for the human body (Food and Nutrition Council, 1980).  AFA improves the body\'s ability to absorb and utilise proteins from food, making it extremely important for children, adolescents, athletes and anyone wishing to optimise protein metabolism (4).</p>\n <p><strong>Antioxidants </strong>- as well as being extremely rich in anti-oxidant pigments, Klamath algae has a broad range of 15 carotenoids in their natural alpha and gamma forms.  And as science has now definitively shown, only this natural spectrum of carotenoids is capable of true anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activity (5).</p>\n <p><strong>Essential Fatty Acids</strong> - Klamath algae has an excellent profile of EFAs and is one of the richest vegetable sources of Omega-3 and Omega-6 in proportions considered optimal for human consumption (2:1).  (Other algae such as Spirulina and Chlorella have practically no Omega-3). This high quality Omega-3 is important for health and low levels in the diet are associated with raised LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (6).</p>\n <p><strong>Nutraceutical Molecules</strong> - AFA is rich in specific molecules: Phycocyanins - powerful selective COX-2 inhibitors (similar to the new anti-inflammatory drugs but without their very dangerous side effects), Phenylethylamine - a brain amino acid directly responsible for increasing the activation and transmission of important neuro-transmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine, Polysaccharides - shown to be potent immunomodulators (7).</p>\n <p><strong>Chlorophyll</strong> - AFA has a very high concentration of chlorophyll, which contributes to the cleansing and detoxification of the blood.  Recent studies confirm that dietary sources of chlorophyll have anti-tumor and hepatoprotective actions (8).</p>\n <p><strong>RECENT STUDIES CONFIRM THE HEALING POWER OF KLAMATH ALGAE</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Inflammation</strong><br />\nA review of cases with proven clinical records by a panel of five physicians from the University of Illinois established a therapeutic ability of the algae in relation to: inflammatory and osteoarthritic conditions, fibromyalgia, allergies both nutritional and respiratory, neurological conditions such as depression and attention deficit disorder (9).</p>\n <p><strong>High Cholesterol and Triglycerides</strong><br />\n Klamath algae has been shown to rapidly normalise the metabolism of fats contributing to a significant reduction in cholesterol and triglycerides (8).  A recent study performed at the University of Urbino, Italy, using Klamath algae and Phycoplus&reg; (phycocyanin extract) confirmed this lipid lowering effect along with a significant reduction in lipid oxidation, the basis of cardiovascular and hepatic diseases and cell ageing (10).</p>\n <p><strong>Hypoglycaemia, Diabetes and Obesity</strong> <br />\n AFA has been proven to inhibit the pancreatic production of alpha-amylase, thereby decreasing excessive glycaemic levels and to partially inhibit the intestinal activity of two enzymes, sucrase and maltase, which are responsible for the assimilation of sugars into the bloodstream.  Together these findings show how AFA can contribute to the resolution of the famed Syndrome X, that combination of excessive glycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia which is at the root of today\'s metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, diabetes and obesity (11).</p>\n <p><strong>NB Loss of control of blood fats and sugar causes rapid physical and mental ageing!</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Stress, Anxiety and Depression</strong></p>\n <p>Disorders such as depression, anxiety and attention deficit disorders figure prominently in the retrospective study quoted earlier.  Until recently, Klamath algae\'s ability to improve stress and nervous conditions was attributed to its general nutritional properties.  But it has been discovered that Klamath algae, if processed using the Refractance Window Method&reg;, contains a significant amount of phenylethylamine (PEA), a brain amino acid directly responsible for increasing the activation and transmission of important neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine.  Supplementation with 10-60mg of PEA was able to cure 60% of clinically diagnosed depressions (12).  Klamath algae, and especially a specific algae extract-Phycoplus&reg;, contain enough PEA to promote better mood, relieve stress and anxiety, help with moderate to serious depressions, and possibly solve problematic yet still not clearly diagnosed conditions such as ADD/ADHD (13).  Indeed, PEA has been named the &quot;molecule of love&quot; due to its increased endogenous production in states such as intense concentration, joyful activities and love (14).</p>\n <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n <p>By including a small amount of Klamath AFA  in your daily diet, you will be providing your body and mind with the full range of nutrients required for optimal health.\n</p>\n <p><strong>References</strong><br />\n1.

More aggressive control of the whole blood glucose profile is essential if we are to prevent the life threatening complications.&quot;  (International Diabetes Federation meeting, Switzerland, June 2002.)</li>\n </ul>\n<p><strong>The reports presented the following:  </strong></p>\n <p><strong>Childhood obesity&hellip;</strong></p>\n <p>One in four children is now obese according to a survey of 2,000 children by the Health and Social Care Information Centre.  Figures show that childhood obesity in England has doubled in 10 years.  From 1995 to 2004, obesity among boys aged 11-15 rose from 14% to 24% and girls from 15% to 26%. The rate rose slightly in the 2 to 10 years age group.  </p>\n <p>Earlier this year, public sector watchdogs the National Audit Office, Healthcare Commission and Audit Commission said good work going on at a local level but added that <strong>the government needed to show more leadership if the push was to succeed. </strong> Public Health Minister Caroline Flint said: &quot;We recognise we need to do more.  &quot;Our public health agenda is the first concerted attempt to seriously tackle rising levels of obesity.&quot;   She added &quot;huge steps forward&quot; have already been taken through campaigns to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and more investment in school sport.  The survey also showed adult obesity is continuing to rise from 13% to 24% for men and 16% to 24% for women.</p>\n <p>Professor Colin Waine, chairman of the National Obesity Forum, said the figures revealed a &quot;public health timebomb&quot;.  &quot;This is serious news because obesity in adolescence is associated with the premature onset of Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.  It really augurs very badly for the future health of the population as these children move from adolescence to adulthood.  This will have a significant impact on longevity and we are in danger of raising a generation of people who have a shorter life expectancy than their parents.  This is a public health timebomb as these children move into adult life.&quot; </p>\n <p>Weight Concern executive director Caroline Swain added: &quot;If we are to preserve the health of the next generation, there is a desperate need for detailed research into what is triggering this rising trend, as well as practical action on a national level to encourage families to adopt healthier lifestyles.&quot;  Shadow Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said:</p>\n <p>&quot;In the last decade British children have got fatter faster than anywhere else in Western Europe. We are at risk of an epidemic of vascular diseases as a result.  Apparently the government\'s white paper in November 2004 talked about an obesity strategy but the implementation has been virtually non-existent.&quot;</p>\n <p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>The overall cost of obesity to the NHS is currently around &pound;1bn, with a further &pound;2.3bn to &pound;2.6bn for the economy as a whole.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Malnutrition in the elderly and hospital patients</strong></p>\n <p>The European Nutrition for Health Alliance reported in late 2005 that urgent action was needed to prevent Europe\'s ageing population from dying of malnutrition.  The number of 80-year-olds doubling every decade means that the number of malnourished people could also grow.  The ENHA said care providers needed to do more work on identifying and treating those most at risk.  This includes people who are sick with long-standing diseases as well as the elderly.  The alliance\'s co-chairman Professor Jean-Pierre Baeyens said: &quot;Malnutrition is indeed endemic. Many people are not aware of the problem. If we do not act now it could increase. We are facing a time bomb.&quot;</p>\n <p>Professor Marinos Elia, Professor of Clinical Nutrition at Southampton University, estimated in a report late last year that:</p>\n <p style=\"text-align:center;\"><strong>malnutrition and associated diseases cost the UK &pound;7 billion a year</strong></p>\n <p>&quot;Hospital expenditure is really quite large.  People who are malnourished tend to stay in hospital longer.&quot;  He said there was also a great deal of malnutrition in the community, particularly among people with low incomes.&quot;</p>\n<p>Following these reports The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) has issued guidance designed to improve the way the NHS deals with malnutrition since it is estimated that as many as 40% of hospital patients are at risk.  The problem is particularly serious among the elderly. It is thought more than 10% of people aged over 65 are malnourished, and as many at 60% of pensioners who are admitted to hospital. </p>\n <p>They recommend all hospital and care home patients should be weighed and measured on admission, and all outpatients should be similarly checked at their first clinic appointment. Checks should be repeated weekly for inpatients, and where there is clinical concern for outpatients, say the guidelines. </p>\n <p>Being malnourished is different from being underweight, although they often go hand in hand. It is possible to be overweight yet malnourished.  </p>\n <p>Dr Mike Stroud, of the Institute of Human Nutrition at the University of Southampton, who helped with the guidelines said, &quot;Ensuring patients receive adequate nutrition is an essential part of basic patient care, yet we know malnutrition is still a big problem for the NHS.  The guidelines contain one obvious and simple message - do not let your patients starve and when you offer them nutrition support, do so by the safest, simplest, most effective route.&quot; </p>\n <p>Professor Elia said, &quot;There is more recognition but it is still not enough&quot;.</p>\n <p>Dr Lorna Layward, of the charity Help the Aged, said the guidelines were &quot;incredibly welcome&quot;.  &quot;Our preoccupation with obesity means that malnutrition of our most vulnerable members of society has been swept under the carpet.&quot; </p>\n <p><span style=\"color: #808080\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"> </span></span></span><strong>Mental health</strong><br />\n New figures released at the beginning of 2006 by the Mental Health Foundation and Sustain show that mental ill-health is costing the UK almost &pound;100 billion a year with evidence pointing towards changes to our diet in the last fifty years.</p>\n <p>A body of evidence linking the impact of diet on mood and behaviour has been growing for many years and now scientific evidence reveals that food can have an immediate and lasting effect upon a person\'s mental health and behaviour because of the way it affects the structure and function of the brain their reports state.</p>\n <p>The Mental Health Foundation and Sustain assert that many nutrients can improve a person\'s mental health, and dietary changes may hold the key to combating specific mental health problems including depression, schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and Alzheimer\'s disease.</p>\n <p>In recent decades, significant changes in the way food is produced and manufactured have not only reduced the amounts of essential fats, vitamins and minerals consumed, but have also disturbed the balance of nutrients in the foods eaten. The proliferation of industrialised farming has introduced pesticides and altered the body fat composition of animals due to the diets they are now fed. As a result, the population\'s intake of omega-3 fatty acids has decreased whilst the consumption of omega-6 fatty acids has increased. According to the research, this unequal intake combined with a lack of vitamins and minerals is associated with depression, concentration and memory problems.</p>\n <p>At the same time, the UK population is consuming less nutritious, fresh produce and more saturated fats and sugars. According to the Mental Health Foundation and Sustain, new substances, such as pesticides, additives and trans-fats have also been introduced to the diet. These alone and in combination, can prevent the brain from functioning effectively.</p>\n <p>Amino acids are also vital to good mental health. Neurotransmitters in the brain are made from amino acids, many of which need to be derived from the diet. A deficiency in certain amino acids can lead to feelings of depression, apathy and leave a person feeling unmotivated and unable to relax.</p>\n <p>Dr Andrew McCulloch, Chief Executive of the Mental Health Foundation, says: \'\'We are well aware of the effect of diet upon our physical health, but we are only just beginning to understand how the brain, as an organ, is influenced by the nutrients it derives from the foods we eat, and how our diets have an impact on our mental health. This evidence raises a number of important questions and concerns for us all, but the knowledge gives individuals the power to make decisions that will benefit them and future generations. On a larger scale, our Government cannot ignore the growing burden of mental ill health in the UK and must look to nutrition as an option in helping people to manage their mental health problems. The potential rewards, in economic terms, and in terms of alleviating human suffering, are enormous.\'\'</p>\n <p>The Mental Health Foundation and Sustain are calling for a major shift in national policy and practice to make nutrition a mainstream factor in mental health care and promotion. Specific recommendations in the Feeding Minds campaign include:</p>\n <ul>\n   <li>The UK population and those at increased risk of mental health problems should be provided with information about foods that promote their mental, emotional and physical well-being</li>\n   <li>UK Health Departments should review and improve food and nutrition standards for the mental health and social care sectors in light of the evidence that a range of nutrients contribute to mental health and well being</li>\n   <li>Primary care should have ready access to information on the link between diet and mental health as well as a working knowledge of the information and expertise available to support people through dietary change</li>\n   <li>All NHS and social care facilities that provide meals to service users, including the independent and not for profit sector, should instigate sustainable food policies and practices, so that all service users and staff are provided with foods that promote their mental, emotional and physical well-being</li>\n   <li>All prison facilities should instigate sustainable food policies and practices so that all residents and staff are provided with foods that promote their mental, emotional and physical well-being</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Mental health</strong></p>\n <ul>\n   <li>Some foods damage the brain by releasing toxins or oxidants that harm healthy brain cells. There are many more nutrients that serve the brain without deception or damage, which can improve mood and mental well-being.</li>\n   <li>A balanced mood and feelings of well being can be protected by ensuring that a diet provides adequate amounts of complex carbohydrates, essential fats, amino acids, vitamins and minerals and water.</li>\n   <li>Research indicates that good nutritional intake may be linked to academic success. A number of studies report that providing children with breakfast improves their daily and long-term academic performance.</li>\n   <li>Among some young offenders, diets supplemented with vitamins, minerals and essential fatty acids have resulted in significant and remarkable reductions in anti-social behaviour.</li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>Mental health problems</strong></p>\n <ul>\n   <li>There is growing evidence that diet plays an important contributory role in specific mental health problems including Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), depression, schizophrenia and Alzheimer\'s disease.</li>\n   <li>The presentation of depression in the UK population has increased dramatically over recent decades and this has been accompanied by a decrease in the age of onset, with more cases being reported in children, adolescents and young adults.</li>\n   <li>The incidence of schizophrenia is similar across the globe, although there are differences in outcomes between countries. This implies that environmental factors have some role in determining the duration and severity of symptoms, and the role that diet has to play is attracting increasing scientific interest.</li>\n   <li>Alzheimer\'s disease has become more common in the past fifty years and is believed to be the result of a combination of factors, including the aging population, genetics and environmental factors. Growing epidemiological evidence suggests that diet may be one of those environmental factors with associations being reported between the occurrence of Alzheimer\'s and high polyunsaturated fat consumption, and low vitamin and mineral consumption.</li>\n   <li>Complementary mental health care services that focus on diet and nutrition report promising results, particularly among those who experience ADHD and depression. On the whole however, they are poorly funded and have received insufficient research attention to draw firm conclusions.</li>\n </ul>','We Are Overfed But Undernourished!','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 17:45:48','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=409',0,'post','',0),(411,2,'2011-02-15 17:53:09','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<p>Peel an orange, squeeze a sprig of lavender or rosemary, or smell a rose, and that lovely scent you get comes from the plant\'s essential oil. Essentials oils are found in leaves, flowers, seeds, barks and roots of plants growing in hot and sunny countries - two key factors necessary for the plant\'s growth.\n<p>Known and appreciated for centuries for their medical properties, essential oils were used more than 4000 years ago in Mesopotamia to cure epidemics and the pharaohs of Egypt used them as the basic component of skincare.\n<p>In 1928 essential oils re-entered the modern world when a French scientist M.Gattefoss&eacute; burned his hand in his laboratory. In an urgency to quell the pain he plunged his hand in a beaker close at hand which happened to contain lavender essential oil. To his surprise, the burn healed very quickly and modern aromatherapy was born.\n<p><strong>Therapeutic benefits</strong>\n<p>Essential oils contain the life force of the plant and each plant carries its own unique quality and energy. An essential oil acts both at the olfactory level, by transmitting a sensation to the neurological system and physically as essential oils are able to penetrate the skin.\n<p>The individual effectiveness of essential oils derives from the richness of their composition, for example:\n<p>Rose: Rosa damascena\n<p>Rose has a very high frequency, similar to the lightness you feel when experiencing loving feelings. Rose is the key oil for celebrating the love you have in your life or for bringing more love into it. Rose also helps to heal wounds of the heart, filling you with love, helping you to mend your heart and nurture your soul.\n<p>Laurel: Citrus bergamia\n<p>Laurel inspires, protects and brings confidence and self-belief. This self-belief and confidence help you to focus on what it is you really want to achieve. Its strength inspires you to go beyond your normal limitations and fears in order to bring your dreams into reality.\n<p>Orange: Citrus sinensis\n<p>Sweet zesty orange brings optimism and vitality. It helps you feel alive with possibilities, dispelling tension, anxieties and fear of failure. The positive attitude that orange brings helps you achieve goals more effortlessly bringing you the successes you deserve.\n<p><strong>A rare commodity</strong> \n<p>Essential oils are fragrant, volatile and insoluble in water but can be dissolved quickly in some plant/vegetable oils. They are obtained by two processes which guarantee pureness and quality:\n\n<ul>\n     <li>distillation with steamed water of aromatic plants (this process must be performed close to the growing area to guarantee the freshness of the essential oil and the water must be of the highest quality e.g. spring water) </li>\n     <li>cold pressure (squeezing), which is used for fruits</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For one pound of Cedar essential oil, you need 35 pounds of plant.</p>\n<p>For one pound of Lavender essential oil, you need 50 pounds of lavender.</p>\n<p>For one pound of Melissa essential oil, you need 3.5 tons of melissa.</p>\n<p>For one drop of Rose essential oil, you need 30 roses!</p>\n<p><strong>Quality matters</strong></p>\n<p>An essential oil needs to be totally pure, and its quality must be guaranteed.

Food allergy occurs when the immune system is inappropriately triggered by a food. Food intolerance results when there is a shortage of digestive enzymes and undigested food particles enter the bloodstream causing a reaction similar to food allergies.\n\nThere are a number of hypotheses as to why the occurrence of allergic reactions appears to be increasing. Some researchers suggest it is due to excessive regular consumption of a limited number of foods and/or the high level of synthetic and artificial additives we are exposed to. Other clinicians believe it is increased chemical pollution in the air and water supply that are to blame. Others promote the concept that our increasingly indoor lives with double-glazing, central heating and close proximity to pets could be at least partly responsible.\n\nThe truth likely lies in a combination of all three. Additional factors appear to be early weaning (early exposure to potential allergens such as cow\'s milk and wheat) or the exposure to newly-created GM elements in food.\n\n<strong>Proper digestion is essential in eliminating food allergic response</strong>\n\nThe role of digestion in <strong>allergies, autoimmune and inflammatory </strong>diseases cannot be overstated. It is well known that molecular fragments of ingested food, primarily protein fragments, recycle through the intestinal membrane, and over time can trigger a series of immune reactions that may first give rise to allergies and later to severe inflammatory autoimmune disorders.  In these cases, digestive enzyme supplements and probiotics can be valid therapeutic aids.\n\nIt has been shown that <strong>enzyme therapy </strong>is effective for preventing the formation of the Circulating immune complexes that cause the chronic intestinal inflammation typical of severe pcthologies such as colitis, Crohn\'s disease and rheumatoid artritis. Harmful bacteria or yeast/fungi in the gut can also be responsible for damaging the integrity of the intestinal wall and it is interesting to note that many allergies do arise after a bout of food poisoning.\n\nClick <a href=\"/cms/2011/02/enzymes-probiotics-help-dieters\">here</a> to read more about probiotics and enzymes.\n\nTreat food intolerances with <a href=\"/vital-shape\">vitalSHAPE</a>.\n\n<strong><a href=\"/vital-shape\">vitalSHAPE</a></strong> is a combined enzymes and probiotic formula, designed to improve the health of the GI system.

So what makes some more resilient than others?  Research gathered from prestigious universities around the world over the last 10-15 years confirms that our susceptibility to illness is directly linked to loss of connection with our inner self and the positive energies offered to us from nature.</p>\n <p>It is easy to understand the harm we may do by distancing ourselves from the natural energies we have evolved with and on which our physiology depends; nourishing food, sunlight, clean air and water, but more difficult perhaps, to grasp the concept of losing our connection with our inner &quot;self&quot; or to begin the process of reconnecting.</p>\n <p><strong>Innate healing energy</strong></p>\n <p>Manifesting through the Autonomic Nervous System to create order in our body, our innate healing force is what many complementary practices seek to encourage.</p>\n <p>Acupuncture, meditation and aromatherapy etc all help foster balance between its sympathetic and parasympathetic branches and it turns out, that this balance is key to unlocking the door to this innate healing force &ndash; our vital energy.</p>\n <p>Profoundly affecting this balance are our emotions.  The ancient philosophers who proclaimed &quot;know thyself&quot; realised the potential of this energy for creating health and treating illness and their wisdom is reflected in the traditional systems of medicine that evolved. Modern day research now confirms their approach and concludes:</p>\n <ul>\n     <li>emotional awareness promotes health and slows ageing </li>\n     <li>suppression of emotions leads to mental and physical illness </li>\n </ul>\n <p><strong>The vibrational energy of our emotions</strong></p>\n <p>When we feel a certain feeling a specific profile of peptides is released in our body.  These peptides and their receptors exist throughout the whole body but are highly concentrated in the gastro-intestinal tract, circulatory, immune, hormonal and nervous systems.  When we experience positive emotions, like joy, gratitude and especially love, we literally &quot;vibrate&quot; with the frequency of the feel-good molecules flowing throughout our entire body (1).  In contrast, negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, sadness and even ordinary small worries release a different profile of peptides, sowing chaos in our physiology (2).</p>\n <p>However, it is not the release/expression of these so called &quot;negative&quot; emotions that causes us problems it is the long term suppression of them that causes illness.</p>\n <p>Life and the human condition constantly presents us with opportunities to experience our feelings allowing us to grow and mature emotionally. If we are afraid to feel our feelings we will stay &quot;stuck&quot; and eventually an illness will arrive that directs us (if we dare), to go inside and explore the feelings we have been avoiding. In so doing, we free ourselves from the negative influence they exert on us.</p>\n <p><strong>Anxiety and Depression</strong></p>\n <p>Anxiety and depression are created by fear: the fear of feeling certain feelings.</p>\n <p>Avoidance is the usual way that people respond to frightening, painful emotions. Instead of facing their fears, they will adopt behaviours which numb their emotions: overeating, overworking, smoking, drinking, and drugs, both legal and illegal, are all used to try and avoid painful feelings.</p>\n <p>And denied emotions make us tired because suppressing emotions takes effort. People who are constantly busy, who never leave enough time to be alone &quot;with&quot; their feelings, means that the sympathetic branch of the ANS is constantly activated..they never switch off and they are more easily stressed etc</p>\n <p>The continual suppression of emotions leads to a loss of tone in the parasympathetic branch.  Over time this erodes the flexibility of our physiological systems &ndash; accelerating the ageing process and precipitating high blood pressure, diabetes and even cancer.  Studies published in such prestigious and authoritative journals as <em>The Lancet</em> and <em>Circulation</em> (the journal published by the American Heart Association) confirm this and the research evidence continues to grow. The mind is constantly &quot;communicating&quot; with the body via nerve pathways and chemical messengers such as neuropeptides, endorphins and hormones, to create either health or illness. In fact so widespread are the receptors for these &quot;molecules of emotion&quot; that it can be said that, <b>the mind really is - <i>in</i> the body</b>. This means that nurturing our inner self is fundamental for creating health. Paying attention to our feelings, thoughts and attitudes may seem like self indulgence, but it is a vitally important process if we are to clear the negative energies that may be holding us back from fully living.</p>\n <p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p>1.

For example Lipase, an enzyme that is abundant in raw foods, digests and metabolises dietary fats. Since very few of us have a diet rich in raw foods we lack sufficient amounts of this enzyme to digest or burn normal quantities of fat. Dietary fat is then laid down as fat stores instead. Protease is another important dietary enzyme which is required for breaking down proteins and eliminating toxins.  Excess toxins are stored in fat which is then very difficult to burn. When you do burn fat, these toxins are released causing water retention and bloating. A diet rich in Protease helps eliminate toxins facilitating fat loss.</p>\n <p><strong>Where Have All The Enzymes Gone?</strong></p>\n <p>If you only eat fresh raw foods then you get enough dietary enzymes to digest those foods. Cooked foods however have zero enzymes. This means your body must manufacture digestive enzymes in the pancreas to digest cooked/processed foods. Normally the pancreas is busy making much needed metabolic enzymes, so when it is repeatedly stressed in this way, it becomes exhausted. You know if your pancreas is exhausted if you start suffering with acid reflux, indigestion, bloating, tiredness after meals, constipation and weight gain. Longer term your whole metabolic system will become compromised making it very <strong>difficult to stay healthy or lose weight.</strong></p>\n <p><strong>The Role of Probiotics in Weight Loss</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Stanford University Study</strong></p>\n <p>In a study conducted at Stanford University, obese patients who took probiotics after undergoing gastric bypass surgery lost more weight than patients who had the surgery but did not take the supplements (1). According to the World Health Organization: &quot;Probiotics are live microorganisms which, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit.&quot; </p>\n <p>Most probiotics are bacteria similar to the type normally found in the gut, the &quot;good&quot; bacteria, which help maintain a balance in the digestive tract and may confer natural protection against disease.</p>\n <p><strong>Nestle Study</strong></p>\n <p>Nestle researchers have shown a link between the composition of gut bacteria with blood glucose control. They demonstrated that modulating gut microbiota improves the regulation of glycemic control and reverses the insulin resistance that occurs with obesity.</p>\n <p>The scientists at the Nestle research centre suggest that the absence of beneficial bacteria in the gut leads to systemic inflammation which contributes to insulin resistance and obesity (2). </p>\n <p><strong>Shaping our future</strong></p>\n <p><strong><a href=\"/vital-shape\">vitalSHAPE</a></strong> is an advanced probiotic and enzyme formula specifically developed to support the health of the gastro-intestinal system and promote optimum whole body health.

This is an incredible advantage for individuals suffering from bone density loss such as osteoporosis and osteopenia.  This is also of great benefit for growing young adults and expectant mothers who need lots of calcium.</p>\n <p><strong>7. Improve Immune Function</strong><br />\nAs the intestine is the <strong>body\'s largest immune system organ</strong>, its ability to efficiently respond to immune attacks is directly related to its balance of healthy bacteria.

Nothing has a greater impact on our quality of life, incidence of illness, or premature death than love and intimacy. (And, thankfully, love and intimacy are free!)</p>\n <p><strong>Studies have shown that people with love and emotional support in their lives are more likely to live longer than people who don\'t have these necessities.</strong> </p>\n <p>An increasing number of cardiologists and psychoneuroimmunologists&mdash;specialists who examine the relationship between the nervous, endocrine, and the immune systems&mdash;have studied what happens to the body when a vital connection to another is broken. While &quot;heartbreak&quot; is not yet listed as a cause of death, there is a growing sense among these specialists that loss of love or a vital connection can contribute to heart disease.</p>\n <p>Heartbreak can trigger chest pain that is frequently indistinguishable from the discomfort resulting from blockages in the coronary blood vessels. The pain of longing for a lost loved one is both literally and metaphorically heartbreaking.</p>\n <p><strong>How do we explain the mechanism that translates loss into physical pain? Does something really break? The answer is yes.</strong></p>\n <p>What breaks is the very real connection that ties two hearts together. Although this connection cannot readily be described in concrete medical terminology, we do know that heartbreak, just like love, affects the whole person.</p>\n <p>Think of your heart not as an independent organ but as orchestrating your entire being. When you feel love, your heart acts as the conductor&mdash;uniting your body, mind, and spirit.</p>\n <p>When we love someone, we feel not only for, but with that person. We need not be mystical to know that love is a bridge between two hearts in accord with each other, like two tuning forks vibrating on the same high level of frequency.</p>\n <p>When a physical connection is severed, such as when a spouse dies after many years of marriage, the partner\'s heart may be broken. The sudden loss of a loved one can devastate a survivor. </p>\n <p><strong>The high cost of emotional shutdown:</strong></p>\n <p>The heart has much to teach us about the high cost of emotional shutdown.</p>\n <p>In short, the heart\'s valves and arteries open and close to pump blood throughout the body. By virtue of their smooth muscle cells and walls, arteries can open and close to shunt blood to areas of special need.</p>\n <p>When there is significant loss of blood flow through the coronary arteries, as with atherosclerosis, the heart suffers from lack of oxygen. And, when these arteries close completely, a heart attack is the result.</p>\n <p>Closing your heart to love can have an equally disastrous effect. Like atherosclerosis, emotional withdrawal can literally suffocate the heart.</p>\n <p><strong>This is why it is so important to allow yourself to feel. </strong>Getting in touch with your feelings of sadness and sorrow in the face of loss might require working with a therapist to acknowledge your grief. Or it might mean reaching out and connecting with an old friend or family member, forgiving yourself or someone else, or learning to share yourself with new friends. Such a loving relationship is doing your heart, and your entire body, a great deal of good!</p>','Why Love Matters','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 18:44:09','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=424',0,'post','',0),(426,2,'2011-02-15 18:44:55','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Understanding Anxiety & Depression','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 18:44:55','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=426',0,'post','',0),(429,2,'2011-02-15 18:45:48','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Dopamine and Weight Gain','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 18:45:48','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=429',0,'post','',0),(432,2,'2016-02-17 13:10:28','2016-02-17 12:10:28','<strong>Depression is a serious condition affecting 1 in 6 people at some time with research showing that experiencing during childhood, when the nervous system is developing rapidly is predictive of depressive illness in later life.</strong>\n\nDespite this evidence, most of the literature on the subject is confined to a discussion of the symptoms with the focus on the adult\'s brain chemistry and the adult\'s cognitions. There is little recognition that the adult brain is itself formed by experiences starting in the womb, or that these may have contributed to a predisposition to depression.\n\nPositive experiencing during childhood encourages the widespread formation of dopamine receptors across the nervous system and conversely, children whose emotional needs were neglected, develop fewer dopamine receptors and have reduced dopamine levels and functioning.\n\nFailing to understand the real cause of depression, pharmaceutical companies capitalise on the \"low serotonin\" doctrine as the cause of depression and make billions from a class of drugs known as \"selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors\" or SSRIs e.g. Citalopram, Fluoxetine (Prozac), Paroxetine (Seroxat).\n\nSSRIs are thought to lift depression by raising the level of serotonin in the synaptic cleft between brain cells.\n\nThe companies profiting from these drugs insist that a shortage of serotonin is the cause of depressive illnesses. However, if this were so, these drugs would work within a few hours or days, when in fact they take weeks before any noticeable difference in mood occurs.\n\nWhat is actually taking place during these few weeks is a gradual desensitisation of serotonin receptors caused by the flooding of the receptors with the artificially high levels of serotonin that are now present in the synaptic cleft linking the brain cells.\n\nThis certainly explains why people taking SSRIs report that they feel \"numb\" or \"flat\". In other words, they have stoped being able to feel not only their uncomfortable feelings, the ones that drove them to seek help, but also any good feelings! Their emotional pain is relieved but the price paid is that they feel NOTHING!\n\nStill, the drugs are heavily promoted and more than 80% of doctors here in the UK admit to over prescibing them. Like many other classes of drugs (e.g. diuretics, H2 receptor antagonists) anti-depressants are only recommended for <strong>short term use by NICE, yet millions of people receive these drugs for years or even decades!</strong>\n\n<strong>Addressing the cause</strong>\n\nIf we firstly acknowledge that human beings are complex, sensitive creatures and that childhood experiencing has the greatest impact on our future mental health, then we can start to wisely treat depression.\n\nThe next step is to allow the natural generation of new connections between the limbic system (where feelings are generated)and the frontal cortex (where feelings are felt), as this was the process that was pruned during childhood.\n\nIn practical terms, this requires the person to examine their thoughts and feelings ideally with a therapist or failing this, a good friend who can listen in a non-judgemental way. This \"safe\" relationship allows the person the opportunity to explore his/her own mind without fear of criticism.\n\nThis process of increasing one\'s self-awareness is very difficult to do alone since a vital part of the process is to have one\'s thoughts and fears reflected back to allow the person to understand the source of discomfort and ultimately the effect these deep feelings and thoughts are affecting the person\'s life. For when we are alone with our thoughts and feelings, we are unable to examine them objectively. Often, when people emerge from such a process, they often exclaim, \"I didn\'t know that I didn\'t know\".\n\n<strong>Pleasure and Reward</strong>\n\nDenial of feelings in childhood leads to a much lower density of dopamine receptors across the nervous system leading to a decreased capacity for pleasure and reward in later life. After all, it is particularly painful to reach out for affirmation and acceptance from other people and fail to receive it, so people, who as children learned that their emotional needs were not important to others, tend to deny their own needs, making it difficult for them to dare to try and have what they truly want in life. This \"adaptive\" profile is created as a self-protection mechanism during childhood but presents later in conditions such as; anxiety, attention deficit disorders, cravings, depression, chronic fatigue, low libido, obesity and panic attacks.\n\n<strong>Personal Growth - Accepting Yourself </strong>\n\nA period of self-examination via therapy or similar is essentially an opportunity for self-acceptance, something that was impossible in the original situation of childhood - for a child whose emotional needs were dismissed by his parents, will automatically dismiss his own emotions as unimportant. And in rejecting one\'s own feelings, the connection with one\'s very core, one\'s soul/spirit  is severed. Left with a feeling of being \"unacceptable/inadequate\", many people respond by constantly striving for outward success (status, money, material possessions) to prove to the world that they really are acceptable, that they really are good enough. Other respond by a general giving up or opting out and turn to alcohol, drugs etc to numb the internal pain they feel.\n\nIt is so sad that so much real human potential is lost through damaged childhoods.\n\n<strong>The role of PEA</strong>\n\nAs well as good therapy there is something else we can turn to to help ourselves grow.\n\nPhenylethylamine (PEA) is a neuroamine that is released in the brain when we feel calm and joyful and people who suffer with depression have been shown to have low levels in the nervous system as measured by the main metabolite of PEA in the urine.\n\nPEA has been coined as the \"love molecule\" by scientists since it is the molecule that flows in abundance when we fall in love.\n\nInterestingly it has been shown that PEA can alleviate depression in 60% of depressed persons, the same percentage as all the major anti-depressants with the major advantage of no negative side effects.\n\nPEA therapy may therefore have a very useful role in the treatment of depressions deserving, as many top scientists believe, to be the first line treatment since it is fast acting and can be used long term without fear of harmful consequences such as weight gain, loss of libido, and other common side effects typical of the anti-depressant drugs\n\nIn addition, increasing levels of PEA is the perfect support for the therapeutic process described above, since it is also a neuro-regenerative molecule helping to create new connections across the brain.\n\n<strong>PEA raises dopamine levels </strong>\n\nPEA acts very rapidly, in a matter of hours or days, instead of weeks. This provides a very useful tool for improving mood and preventing suicide. Particularly important is the fact that PEA is very effective in bipolar patients, as this illness represents a high risk for suicide.\n\nPEA therapy alone may be enough to lift a depressed person out from his low mood and by virtue of its neuro-regenerative powers and ability <strong>to raise the level of freely circulating dopamine in the central nervous system </strong>it can enhance progress during any type of therapy. PEA improves mood, and the knock on effect on dopamine levels allows the generation of positive feelings: something which may have been absent for a very long time.\n\nFor research studies and references supporting the role and use of PEA please email me at: janice@simplyvital.com\n\nFor further information on PEA or to buy a supplement with a high concentration of PEA please see <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitallift\"><strong>VitalLIFT</strong></a>.','Depression & Emotional Growth','','publish','open','closed','','depression-and-emotional-growth','','','2016-02-17 13:10:28','2016-02-17 12:10:28','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=432',0,'post','',0),(434,2,'2011-02-15 19:14:48','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<p><strong>Symptoms indicative of a &quot;leaky gut&quot; include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> Allergies/food intolerances</li>\n<li>Arthritis/rheumatism</li>\n<li>Asthma/atopic eczema</li>\n<li>Chronic fatigue</li> \n<li>Coeliac disease/Crohn\'s disease</li>\n<li>Colitis/enteritis</li>\n</ul>\n  <p>Often called &quot;the second brain&quot;, because of the high concentration of neuro-peptides and neuro-transmitter receptors present along both the large and small intestine, the gastro-intestinal (GI) system is highly responsive to any emotional or mental distress we might be experiencing and it is the <strong>first organ system to lose its blood supply during a stress response</strong>.</p>\n  <p>A constant blood supply to the GI tract is very important since the lining cells forming the barrier between the contents of the intestines and the blood are replaced approximately every 14 hours and need a constant supply of nutrients to allow this cell turnover. Hence, the blood supply (at rest), to the GI tract is <strong>greater than any other resting organ system in the body</strong>.</p>\n  <p>This rapid cell turnover means that the GI tract particularly sensitive to any nutrient deficiencies in the diet as well as any stresses which have the same nutrient depleting effect by starving the lining of its blood supply.</p>\n  <p>When the lining cells are no longer replaced effectively, digestive health begins to be compromised.  Our entire health is then put at risk as nutrients are less effectively absorbed and the lining cells suffer even more.  The downward spiral has begun!  It is at this stage that we can become more sensitive to environmental toxins and undigested proteins and increasingly susceptible to invading organisms and even our own emotional responses.</p>\n  <p>If the repair mechanisms worsen, a loss of integrity of the barrier function can occur creating the condition known as <strong>&quot;leaky gut syndrome&quot;</strong>. Partially digested food, toxic chemicals, whole bacteria, viruses and parasites are then able to enter the bloodstream.</p>\n  <p>Once in the circulation these substances are recognised as being &ldquo;foreign&rdquo; by the body, provoking an increase in the number of white blood cells (leucocytes) in the circulation. Circulating Immune Complexes are then formed as these blood cells attempt to neutralise the foreign substance. If the lining of the GI tract is not quickly repaired, the production of leucocytes becomes excessive and chronic, invariably causing inflammation locally in the GI tract or elsewhere in the body (1).</p>\n  <p>Many chronic auto-immune conditions are caused by these immunological reactions, as the raised level of circulating antibodies mistakenly attacks our own tissues. </p>\n  <p><strong>Friendly helpers</strong></p>\n  <p>A healthy GI tract is home to approximately 10<sup>14</sup> \'friendly\' bacterial cells of more than 500 species weighing approximately 1.35 kg.  Beavering away inside, they contribute to our health by secreting important compounds such as butyric acid, vitamins and natural antibiotics, which prevent the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria.  They also digest certain foods and support the body\'s immune function.  Generally, friendly bacteria maintain an intestinal environment that promotes healthy intestinal mucosa (2).  However, they too are also easily disturbed by a poor diet, illness, or any emotional or physical stress or trauma (including surgery), <strong>and can be wiped out completely by antibiotics.</strong> </p>\n  <p><strong>True protectors</strong></p>\n  <p>The distal part of the GI tract, which is home to the majority of these bacteria, used to be considered almost as an appendage of the digestive tract, whose principal purpose was the conservation of salt and water, and the disposal of waste materials.  However it is now recognised that the metabolic potential of the human colonic microflora is impressive in terms of the number of biochemical reactions and transformations in which it participates.  Bacteria play a key role in numerous processes in the large bowel, including carbohydrate and protein fermentation, bile acid and steroid transformations, metabolism of xenobiotic substances, development of the immune system, as well as the activation and destruction of potential mutagenic metabolites (3).  </p>\n  <p>Healthy microbiota also play an important role in stimulating colonic motility and decreasing transit time-therefore reducing the opportunity for fermentation and the production of pathogenic catabolites by potentially pathogenic micro-organisms.</p>\n  <p>Indeed, the GI bacterial flora exert their many effects mainly through catabolic pathways.  For example, in exchange for the supply of complex carbohydrates (starches and non-starch polysaccharides) from the host, intestinal bacteria produce butyrate, a bacterial fermentation product and principal source of energy for epithelial cells in the distal bowel.</p>\n  <p><strong>The role of probiotics</strong></p>\n  <p>Today\'s Western diet (high in fat, sugar, salt and low in vegetable fibres, minerals such as potassium, magnesium, calcium, and chromium, Omega-3 fatty acids, membrane lipids, vitamins and antioxidants) has been shown to predispose humans to inflammatory, infectious, ulcerative, degenerative and neoplastic diseases.  Such diets show a <strong>virtual absence of beneficial bacteria</strong>.  Called probiotic, because they are literally \'for life\', these beneficial bacteria are part of naturally preserved foods such as sauerkraut, yoghurt, and kefir.  A probiotic can be best defined as a live microbial food supplement that beneficially affects the host animal by improving its intestinal microbial balance.</p>\n  <p>Most organisms studied in this respect are lactic acid producers, namely the lactobacilli and bifidobacteria, which stand out as being essential not only for the functionality of the intestines but also for the reinforcement of the natural defence of the whole body.  Human and animal studies <em>in vivo</em>, as well as numerous clinical studies, indicate that intestinal flora positively affect many organ systems distant from the gut.  Similarly an overgrowth of the wrong bacteria, which may establish themselves after a course of antibiotics can provoke disease states far away from the gut, for example:</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li> Arthritis: For reasons not fully understood, the wrong bacteria in the digestive system can cause or worsen arthritis.  This ailment is strongly associated with GI problems such as colitis, coeliac and Crohn\'s disease.</li>\n    <li>Hyperactivity and Autism: These conditions have been linked with toxins in the gut produced by harmful bacteria.</li>\n    <li>Alzheimer\'s and Parkinson\'s diseases: research suggests that an overload of these gut toxins may be responsible for the destruction of brain and nerve cells.</li>\n  </ul>\n\n  <p><strong>To encourage the growth of friendly bacteria:</strong></p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>avoid sugar to prevent yeast overgrowth in the colon</li>\n    <li>regularly consume insoluble fibre from corn and wheat bran to feed the good bacteria</li>\n    <li>avoid alcohol and antibiotics</li>\n    <li>minimise stress as much as possible.</li>\n</ul>\n  <p>However there is no substitute for the use of <strong>high-quality probiotic supplements</strong>.  Just about everyone, even those who do not have GI problems will benefit from their anti-ageing, disease fighting effects.  Potency and purity are especially important when choosing a brand since the bacteria are, after all, alive.</p>\n  <p><strong>For a probiotic to be effective it must</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li>retain potency during storage</li>\n    <li>survive passage through acid and bile mediums</li>\n    <li>attach to the intestinal walls and proliferate well</li>\n    <li>compete with any pathogenic bacteria present</li>\n    <li>produce B group vitamins and enzymes</li>\n    <li>stimulate a beneficial immune response</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>Many products currently marketed claim some or all of these properties but on testing, <strong>some 70-90% regularly fail to comply </strong>with even their own claims.  Either the strain declared on the label is not the one actually present, or it is mixed with other strains; a problem which is often coupled with the further negative fact that the actual bacterial count on average is significantly lower than that declared. </p>\n  <p>Therefore, it is necessary to select probiotic strains based on the ability of the manufacturer both to guarantee their actual nomenclature and adopt biotechnological and/or other methods to enhance stability and activity over time.</p>\n  <p>The most reliable, commercially available strain to guarantee a strong stability over time at room temperature, together with correct nomenclature and high count, is the <strong>Lactobacillus acidophilus strain DDS-1</strong>, manufactured according to the proprietary methodology developed by Prof. Shahani at the University of Nebraska (4).  <strong><span style=\"font-family: &quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;\"> </span></strong></p>\n  <p><strong>Lactobacillus acidophilus DDS-1</strong></p>\n  <p>The ability to stimulate a primary immune response in the gut is one of the main benefits of a good probiotic, and is strictly associated with the contribution that such a probiotic can make against pathologies such as allergies, inflammatory conditions, diarrhoea and even cancer.  Diarrhoea is a pathology that involves both a bacterial and a virus infection, and probiotics that can both produce natural antibiotics and can stimulate an immune-based anti-viral response are indeed very effective in different types of diarrhoea, from children to adults and travellers.</p>\n  <p>Different types of human strain probiotics have been shown to be active against diarrhoea (5).  L.acidophilus DDS-1 is known to produce the powerful natural antibiotic &quot;acidophilin&quot; , which has been shown to strongly inhibit at least 23 pathogenic bacteria, including streptococci, salmonella, staphylococci, pseudomonas, proteus, shigella and E.coli, one of the major culprits of diarrhoea (6).  Given also its ability to stimulate a local immune response, L.acidophilus DDS-1 has indeed all the requirements and has been repeatedly proven to be a powerful tool against diarrhoea as well as other bacterial and viral infections (7).  DDS-1\'s immunological proerties extend also into the very important area of tumor prevention and treatment.  It does this by preventing the transformation of nitrates and nitrites into nitrosamines and has been repeatedly proven to inhibit tumor cell proliferation up to 41% in vivo! (8)</p>\n  <p>DDS-1 also has the ability to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood (9).  It has been proven to produce higher levels of lactase and beta-galactosidase enzymes than most other lactobacilli, thus proposing itself an important addition in the treatment of lactose intolerance (10).</p>\n  <p><strong>Enzymes</strong></p>\n  <p>Enzymes catalyse and regulate all biological reactions within an organism. Digestive enzymes, such as protease, amylase, lipase, and lactase, are a sub-class of body enzymes and a strict correlation exists between digestive enzymes and other anti-oxidant and systemic enzymes.  In order to understand this correlation, which shows how poor digestion influences an individual\'s general health, one first needs to understand that foods are pre-digested by the very same enzymes contained within them.</p>\n  <p>It is well known that raw and fermented foods are naturally rich in the specific enzymes needed for their digestion.  Therefore, unpasteurised dairy products are naturally rich in lipase and lactase; sprouted cereals contain high quantities of amylase and glycoamylase; and raw meat is rich in protease.</p>\n  <p>During the first hour of digestion, which occurs in the upper part of the stomach (the cardiac portion), partial &quot;self-digestion&quot; of raw, unpasteurised foods takes place.  This reduces the quantity of enzymes that the pancreas and intestine have to produce during the following stages of digestion, resulting not only in better digestion and assimilation of foods, but also allowing the pancreas to dedicate itself to the production of anti-oxidant, energetic, and systemic enzymes.</p>\n  <p>Unfortunately, in the modern world, it is very difficult to maintain a diet rich in raw, vital foods. The cooked and devitalised foods we eat (partly out of necessity since eating certain raw foods, like meat, can create health risks) do not go through the &quot;self-digestion&quot; process, which causes greater stress on the pancreas and forces it to work harder.  In fact, the pancreas of individuals living in industrialised countries is often hypertrophic.</p>\n  <p><strong>With time the general enzyme production of the pancreas, as well as the entire endocrine system, is subjected to great stress, which can even lead to total energetic, hormonal and metabolic breakdown</strong>.</p>\n  <p>Supplementing with natural, effective enzymes, such as those found in the Aspergillus fungus, which <strong>perform the same function as pancreatic enzymes</strong>, not only quickly eliminates digestion and assimilation problems, but also helps regenerate an individual\'s entire metabolic and energetic system. They improve digestion and food assimilation, relieving the pancreas from overwork, allowing it to restore immune and systemic enzyme production.</p>\n<p>Taken away from meals, fungal enzymes can also neutralise the toxic molecules, which may be</p>','Symptoms of a Leaky Gut','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 19:14:48','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=434',0,'post','',0),(436,2,'2011-02-15 19:24:16','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<p><strong>Chocolate hit the headlines this week when a GP called for it to be taxed....</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Raw Cocoa (Cacoa) - The Good News</strong></p>\n <p><strong>Theobroma Cacao, </strong>the tree&rsquo;s scientific name, literally means <strong>&ldquo;The Food of the Gods.&rdquo; </strong>Indigenous to Central and South America, the cacao tree is commonly called &ldquo;chocolate tree&rdquo;, and it is from the seeds of the tree (cacao beans,) that we obtain cacao and is <strong>the most revered food in all the rainforest</strong>. It has a biochemical and pharmacological complexity unmatched by any other food source in the jungle.</p>\n <p>Raw cacao is a powerhouse of nutrients, ranging from carbohydrates (at 40%), protein (average 14%), free-form amino acids, essential fats and fatty acids (extracted as cocoa butter), bioflavonoids, minerals, to a variety of compounds with well-known pleasant, enhancing pharmacological properties. It is high in sulphur, magnesium, and calcium. In fact, cacao is considered to be one of the higher assimilable sources of magnesium (at .5%) in all of nature. Magnesium is a mineral that has important functions throughout the body, supporting both the heart and the brain, both muscles and bones. Magnesium has a soothing effect in menstruation, which is thought to be one reason why women crave chocolate at certain times.</p>\n <p>Raw Cacao is also surprisingly rich in antioxidants, having higher levels of polyphenol flavonoids than either red wine or green tea. In the ORAC scale used to measure the antioxidant levels of fruits and vegetables, cacao came out at the far, high end of the chart. It is considered, in fact, to be one of the richest sources of antioxidants of any food. </p>\n <p><strong>The pharmacology of cacao is extraordinary</strong></p>\n <p>Cacao flavonoids have been shown to improve the microcirculation, helping collagen and connective tissue formation, and have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties. And the antioxidants in cacao have been shown to reduce LDL (&ldquo;bad cholesterol&rdquo;) oxidation.</p>\n <p><strong>Mesquite</strong></p>\n <p>is often referred to as<strong> &ldquo;The Stabilizer&rdquo;.</strong> The mesquite tree is found in the Middle East, India, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, and the American Southwest. It is in the family of Leguminosae and is native to deserts, so it is heat and drought tolerate. Traditional uses included woodworking and mesquite charcoal. It has deep roots like alfalfa, which can go down as far as 100 feet. The mesquite tree produces bean pods which are milled whole to make a ground meal.</p>\n <p><strong>Mesquite is also another traditional food, newly discovered, like quinoa and amaranth</strong></p>\n <p>As with copomo in Mexico, cacao worldwide, and many sustainable trees that provide fruit, nuts, and seeds, mesquite is known for its continuous yields that provide both nutrition and a sustainable livelihood. Mesquite stabilizes the land (arroyos, banks, hills) as well as the body.</p>\n <p><strong><u>Mesquite is an antifungal, antimicrobial, and antispasmodic</u></strong>. It helps stop excessive bleeding and fevers. It is used in first aid as a paste for stings, scrapes, cuts, and insect bits. Mesquite contains soluble fiber and is a slow acting carbohydrate. It therefore helps balance and control blood sugar by its slower, steady rate of absorption into the bloodstream. Diabetes is a decline in glucose tolerance. Mesquite is an antidiabetic natural sweetener (often made into a porridge) which, because it contains fructose, provides effective use of insulin metabolism, plus having high fiber. Its glycemic index is 25.</p>\n <p><strong><u>Many of the Southwest native peoples</u></strong> who have abandoned mesquite and other traditional foods for a modern diet have had to contend with obesity and diabetes. When returning to a traditional diet, these problems are greatly controlled. Historically, the Southwest desert tradition that used lima beans, chia seeds, prickly pear pods, squash, red and white corn, anasazi beans, amaranth and Pinole (toasted ground cornmeal), all that complement mesquite meal, have provided health and survival benefits and future security to arid lands.</p>\n <p><strong><u>Like dehulled hemp seeds, mesquite is mineral rich</u></strong>, providing in particular calcium, magnesium, potassium, iron, sulfur, and manganese. Mesquite is on the average 14% protein. Its high lysine content provides a perfect balance to the high arginine of cacao.

However, his motion calling for a tax on chocolate was defeated by two votes at a BMA conference in Clydebank.He said he was &quot;disappointed&quot; but glad his suggestion had provoked debate. <!-- E SF --></p>\n <p>Speaking after the vote, Dr Walker, who is also a trained food scientist and nutritionist, said: &quot;A little of what you fancy may do you some good, but as nearly one in four people in Scotland are obese a lack of physical activity, an unhealthy diet and larger portion sizes are clearly taking their toll on the health of Scotland.</p>\n <p>&quot;Chocolate has lost its status as a special treat and I think that if we charged a tax on it then, over a number of years, we could restore that status.&quot;</p>\n <p>He had earlier told the BBC news website that obesity was a &quot;mushrooming&quot; problem, and Scotland risked heading the same way as the United States. He added: &quot;There is an explosion of obesity and the related medical conditions, like type 2 diabetes. I see chocolate as a major player in this, and I think a tax on products containing chocolate could make a real difference.&quot;</p>\n <p>Dr Walker said that a 225g bag of chocolate sweets contained almost 1,200 calories - almost half the recommended daily calorie intake for a man - and could be eaten incredibly quickly.</p>\n <p>He warned that many people were consuming this amount of chocolate on a daily basis, as well as their normal meals, and were unaware of the harm it was doing.</p>\n <p>He said: &quot;There is lots of negative publicity about other fast food and junk food but chocolate is sneaking under the radar. &quot;People have been lulled into a false sense of security about chocolate.</p>\n <p>&quot;I had one patient recently who said to me she thought chocolate was good for you. People are being brainwashed into believing this.&quot;</p>\n <p>Under Dr Walker\'s proposal, presented at the annual conference of Scottish Local Medical Committees, revenue raised from taxing chocolate products would be used by the NHS to deal with the health problems caused by obesity.</p>\n <p>He also argued that the extra money raised could be spent on increasing and improving sports facilities. <!-- S IBOX --><!-- E IBOX --></p>\n <p>Dr Walker said: &quot;After eating a bag of chocolate sweets you would have to walk continuously for three hours to burn off the calories consumed.</p>\n <p>&quot;It is simply not enough to say people should get more exercise. They also need to moderate their chocolate intake and this tax would help them do that.&quot;</p>\n <p>But representatives from the food and drinks manufacturing industry dismissed Dr Walker\'s suggestion.</p>\n <p>Julian Hunt, of the Food and Drink Federation, said: &quot;Introducing regressive taxes on the foods that consumers love would result only in lighter wallets, not smaller waists - particularly as we already have to pay VAT on all our chocolate purchases.</p>\n <p>&quot;While good for grabbing headlines, there is no evidence to suggest that such \'fat taxes\' would actually work in reality.</p>\n <p>&quot;Indeed, when the BMA debated a similar motion in 2003 its members voted against such an idea on the grounds that such a taxation policy would have no effect on obesity, would hit lower income groups hardest and would be a bureaucratic nightmare.&quot;</p>\n </span></div>\n <p><strong>&quot;Irresponsible&quot; marketing techniques are being used to sell chocolate and fuel Britain\'s obesity problem, Tory leader David Cameron has said.</strong></p>\n <p>In a health speech, Mr Cameron pointed to shops, including at train stations, offering cut-price chocolate bars.</p>\n <p>He asked: &quot;As Britain faces an obesity crisis, why does WH Smith\'s promote half-price Chocolate Oranges at its checkouts instead of real oranges?&quot;</p>\n <p>WH Smith denies acting irresponsibly and says it offers customers choice. A spokeswoman said dried fruit and other products, as well as chocolate, were on sale in its outlets. And promotions varied - with water among the healthy options promoted in the past, she said. &quot;They are marketed at adults,&quot; she said. &quot;It\'s about choice - you don\'t have to purchase the products.&quot;</p>\n <p><strong>Double-edged sword</strong></p>\n <p>He told the King\'s Fund in London that business had a shared responsibility to help improve public health. &quot;Modern marketing techniques can be used to great effect to tackle the root causes of preventable ill-health... just as irresponsible marketing techniques can have the opposite effect,&quot; he said.</p>\n <p>&quot;Try and buy a newspaper at the train station and, as you queue to pay, you\'re surrounded, you\'re inundated by cut price offers for giant chocolate bars.&quot;</p>\n <p>Mr Cameron said many shops could do more to promote healthy diets and lifestyles - and that was good business because it reduced sickness costs.</p>\n<p>&quot;Of course we cannot regulate in this regard but can point the finger, we can ask awkward questions and we can put some pressure on and I believe politicians and others should do so,&quot; he added.</p>','Wean yourself off chocolate','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 19:24:16','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=436',0,'post','',0),(439,2,'2011-02-15 19:51:23','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<p><strong>Flu Was Not the Real Killer in the 1918 Pandemic</strong></p>\n<p><img alt=\"flu, pandemic, influenza, pneumonia, virus, bacteria\" align=\"right\" style=\"width: 400px; height: 204px\" src=\"http://articles.mercola.com/ImageServer/public/2009/February/2.28pandemic.bmp\" />Strep infections, rather than the flu virus itself, may have killed most people during the 1918 influenza pandemic. This suggests that some of the most dire predictions about a potential new pandemic could be exaggerated.</p>\n<p>Scientists looked at the available information regarding the 1918 flu pandemic, which killed anywhere between 50 million and 100 million people globally in the space of about 18 months. Some research has shown that on average it took a week to 11 days for people to die, which fits in more with the known pattern of a bacterial infection than a viral infection.</p>\n<p>People with influenza often get what is known as a &quot;superinfection&quot; with a bacterial agent. In 1918 it appears to have been Streptococcus pneumoniae.</p>\n<p>Many projections for a new pandemic have been based on a worst-case 1918 scenario, in which tens of millions of people would die globally. However, since strep is much easier to treat than the flu using modern medicine, a new pandemic might be much less dire than it was in the early 20th century.</p>\n\n <p>Sources:</p>\n<p>\n<img border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://articles.mercola.com/Themes/mercolaArticle/images/bullet.gif\" />  <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/scienceNews/idUSTRE5146PD20090205?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=scienceNews&amp;sp=true\">Reuters February 5, 2009</a></p>\n<p>\n<img border=\"0\" alt=\"\" src=\"http://articles.mercola.com/Themes/mercolaArticle/images/bullet.gif\" />  \n<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?orig_db=PubMed&amp;db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Search&amp;term=%22Emerging%20infectious%20diseases%22%5BJour%5D%20AND%202009%5Bpdat%5D%20AND%20Klugman%5Bauthor%5D\">Emerging Infectious Diseases February 2009; 15(2):346-7</a></p>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n   <tbody>\n       <tr>\n           <td width=\"45\" align=\"left\"><img border=\"0\" hspace=\"0\" alt=\"Dr. Mercola\'\'s Comments\" width=\"45\" height=\"52\" src=\"http://articles.mercola.com/themes/MercolaArticle/images/Dr.Mercola.jpg\" /></td>\n           <td></td>\n       </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\n   <tbody>\n       <tr>\n           <td>Dr. Mercola\'s Comments:</td>\n       </tr>\n   </tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Most health experts agree that another pandemic of influenza is inevitable. But what most fail to understand is that the real answer is not stockpiling more vaccines and antibiotics &ndash; which more often than not are ineffective anyway. </p>\n<p>I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve heard of the U.S. government projections, in which some 200,000 to two million people are bound to perish, based on the worst-case 1918 scenario mentioned above.</p>\n<p>However, not only does it now appear these projections were based on flawed assumptions about the cause of death itself, I&rsquo;ve long argued that similar conditions, like the </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/10/25/avian-flu-epidemic-is-a-hoax.aspx\">bird-flu pandemic</a> envisioned,  is pure fantasy to begin with.</p>\n<p><strong>Why You Shouldn&rsquo;t Place Your Bets on a Pneumonia Vaccine</strong></p>\n<p>In the article above, they mention that we now have vaccines that protect against many different strains of S. pneumonia &ndash; of which there are more than 90 different serotypes &ndash; that cause infections from pneumonia to meningitis.</p>\n<p>However, many of these vaccines simply do not work and come with a number of dangerous side effects, so personally, I would not bet on a vaccine to prevent another pandemic of any kind. The <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2003/05/17/pneumonia-vaccine-part-two.aspx\">pneumonia vaccine</a>, for example, which is recommended for all adults over 65 years of age, does <i>not reduce the risk of contracting the disease</i>, according to researchers.</p>\n<p>Worse yet, another pneumonia vaccine designed for infants <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/07/31/12-babies-die-during-vaccine-trials-in-argentina.aspx\">killed at least a dozen children in Argentina</a> just last year. Meanwhile, according to UNICEF, the most effective forms of prevention of pneumonia in children include: </p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Exclusive breast feeding </li>\n  <li>Promoting adequate nutrition and zinc supplementation </li>\n  <li>Reducing indoor air pollution </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Additionally, after reviewing a total of 10 studies, investigators at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, and the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that using zinc supplementation alone <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/02/zinc-prevents-pneumonia.aspx\">reduces the risk of pneumonia by 41 percent</a>!</p>\n<p>But be careful, and do not use this study to give you a blanket recommendation to supplement with zinc as everyone is different and indiscriminate supplementation without the guidance of a trained  health care professional can be problematic and actually make the condition worse.</p>\n<p>Compare that to another recent GSK vaccine trial in Gambia that boasted about a 37 percent reduction in pneumonia cases&hellip;</p>\n<p>Another little-known pneumonia-buster is good old fashioned essential oils.</p>\n<p>Researchers have found that some <b>essential oils -- oregano, thyme and rosewood oils in particular -- create an autolytic reaction in organisms, including Streptococcus pneumonia</b> identified as the real culprit behind the 1918 mass mortality.</p>\n<p>Spraying these essential oils in the laboratory simply <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/02/organano-destroys-strep.aspx\">made the pneumonia cells fall apart</a>! The oils are much safer than zinc and I believe can be used without more careful supervision.</p>\n<p>The best results occurred with oregano, thyme and rosewood, and intermediate inhibition of the pathogens was achieved with cinnamon oil and clove oil.</p>\n<p><strong>What About another Flu Pandemic? Are You at Risk?</strong></p>\n<p>When it comes to the flu, to avoiding becoming a statistic you need to be aware that <strong>your vitamin D levels play a direct role in your risk of getting the flu!</strong> <br />\n  <br />\nThe vitamin D levels in your blood fall to their lowest point during flu season, which generally coincide with low-sunlight seasons. Less than optimal vitamin D levels will significantly impair your immune response and make you far more susceptible to contracting colds, influenza, and other respiratory infections.</p>\n<p>Dr. John Cannell and colleagues introduced the hypothesis that influenza is a symptom of vitamin D deficiency in their paper <i><a href=\"http://www.whale.to/a/cannell.html\">Epidemic Influenza and Vitamin D</a></i><i>, </i>published in the journal <i><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?orig_db=PubMed&amp;db=pubmed&amp;cmd=Search&amp;term=Epidemiology%20and%20infection%5BJour%5D%20AND%201129%5Bpage%5D%20AND%202006%5Bpdat%5D\">Epidemiology and Infection</a></i> two years ago, and published additional research on this topic in a recent issue of the <i><a href=\"http://www.virologyj.com/content/5/1/29\"><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">Virology Journal</span></span></a></i><i>.</i> Remarkably, they found that 2,000 IU of vitamin D per day abolished the seasonality of influenza!</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, conventional medicine&rsquo;s answer to preventing the flu is not to increase vitamin D levels, but rather to encourage, or even mandate, flu shots. What they don&rsquo;t tell you is that flu shots, at best don&rsquo;t work, and at worst, can make your health worse.</p>\n<p>If you maintain your vitamin D levels in the optimal range, the odds of you getting the flu are very remote.  However, you can also use vitamin D therapeutically to TREAT the flu.</p>\n<p>According to Dr. John Cannell, founder of the Vitamin D Council, who has been successfully using vitamin D therapeutically for a number of years, the therapeutic dose is 2,000 units per kilogram of body weight (one pound is 0.45 kg). </p>\n<p>The dose would be taken once a day for three days. (This could be a very large dose if you are very heavy &ndash; as high as 2-300,000 units per day).  If you start this program early on in the illness, it should be able to completely wipe out the flu in short order.</p>\n<p>For more information about safe sun exposure and tanning, vitamin D testing, and the recommended forms of supplementation when sufficient sunlight is not available, please see my article <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2002/02/23/vitamin-d-deficiency-part-one.aspx\">Test Values and Treatment for Vitamin D Deficiency</a><span style=\"font-family: Arial\"><span style=\"font-size: small\">, which includes recent, and vital, updates.</span></span></p>\n<p>Yet another powerful supplement to keep in your home arsenal is olive leaf extract, which you can find in most any health food store. <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/09/25/olive-leaf-extract-lowers-blood-pressure.aspx\">Olive leaf extract has been found to be a potent broad-spectrum antiviral agent</a>, active against all viruses tested, including numerous strains of influenza and para-influenza viruses.</p>\n<p><strong>Why You Need Not Worry About the Bird Flu</strong></p>\n<p>One type of flu referenced most often when the discussion turns to potential pandemics is the H5N1 influenza, also known as the bird flu.

We all face some stress everyday, but if stress becomes overwhelming then your body will be less able to fight off the flu and other illness.</p>\n  <p>\n  If you feel that stress is taking a toll on your health, consider using an energy psychology tool such as the Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), which is remarkably effective in relieving stress associated with all kinds of events, from work to family to trauma.

When you exercise, you increase your circulation and your blood flow throughout your body. The components of your immune system are also better circulated, which means your immune system has a better chance of finding an illness before it spreads.

Washing your hands will decrease your likelihood of spreading a virus to your nose, mouth or other people. Be sure you don\'t use antibacterial soap for this -- antibacterial soaps are completely unnecessary, and they cause far more harm than good. Instead, identify a simple chemical-free soap that you can switch your family to. </li>\n</ul>\n <p>Do a detox twice yearly at the major change of seasons as the people of the Med do..that\'s now during Sping and in the Autumn.</p>\n<p><strong>Green your commute</strong><br />\n Ride or walk on your next errand.

At least when sleeping, reduce the emissions from electricity in your environment. Turn off all lights that are not in use, and unplug appliances that are not running, like the toaster, hair dryer, electric can opener, television. This saves energy and improves your sleep. Also turn off your computer and especially your wireless modem. Do not keep your cell phone near your body as you sleep. Move the charger far from your bedroom, and especially far from your head.

Living more in tune with nature the people there are aware of how the Earth’s changing position is affecting them and they respond by:\n<ul>\n	<li>reducing the amount of food they consume to rest the digestive system allowing energy to be diverted to cleansing rather than digesting</li>\n	<li>eating more seasonal vegetables to provide important nutrients, helping to quell the toxins beginning to be expelled from cells</li>\n	<li>reaching for their traditional herbal recipe to support the detoxification process and promote liver health</li>\n</ul>\nThe <strong>reason for this detox </strong>as we approach winter is that stored toxins prevent the immune system from functioning optimally. By cleansing the body as winter approaches, the liver, which is a major immune system organ, has the capacity to continue in its role of producing systemic and immune system enzymes to help counter infections.\n\nWorking with a Naturopathic Physician in Italy we have developed <strong><a href=\"/vital-detox\">vitalDETOX</a></strong>, a formula based on this tradition. Add water and lemon juice and drink ten minutes before food. Do this for four weeks and live more in tune with nature.\n\n<strong>A word on pollution</strong>\n\nIt has been estimated that there are some 50,000 chemicals in circulation, with 10,000 of these used in food processing and unless we have a healthy liver we can not break down these potentially harmful chemicals that reach us via food, personal care and cleaning products, air and water.\n\nAs the toxic burden on the liver increases, toxins will move through the body causing disruption and damage, before eventually being stored for years mainly in the fat cells of our organs and tissues. Depending on the type of toxins held in the body, we can experience all sorts of chronic and degenerative conditions that have their underlying cause in an overwhelming burden of chemical overload.\n\n<strong>Detoxing to support liver function</strong>\n\nAmong its many other important functions, the liver is the organ that continually neutralises the toxins that find their way into our systems, converting them into safer substances for excretion via the kidneys, skin and lungs.\n\nAny excesses we indulge in such as fatty or rich food, refined sugar and alcohol <span style=\"color: #333333;\">reduces the detoxing capacity of the liver, affecting the liver\'s central role in keeping us healthy.</span>\n\nA gentle detox designed to lower the toxic burden accumulated in our tissues, while supporting the organs of elimination in a supportive and nurturing environment, is the ideal type of detox programme to offer the most effective results and, ideally, we would engage in such a programme twice yearly.\n\n(Some therapists suggest more severe detox programmes, but this is not always convenient and often a milder, gentler detox is more appropriate since the more toxic your liver and digestive tract, the more dangerous an aggressive detox can be.)','Detox Now for Winter Health!','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2012-04-30 10:25:24','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=441',0,'post','',0),(443,2,'2011-02-15 19:55:45','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Treating Low Dopamine Levels','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 19:55:45','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=443',0,'post','',0),(445,2,'2011-02-15 20:08:03','0000-00-00 00:00:00','<p><strong>Restless Legs Syndrome </strong>is a neurological condition associated with altered dopamine functioning within the central nervous system rather than a problem with the legs themselves. This is the conclusion drawn from extensive research studies performed across the globe.  </p>\n <h2>What is restless legs?</h2>\n <p>Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is characterised by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable urge to move when at rest to try to relieve these feelings. Often described as burning, creeping, tugging, or like insects crawling inside the legs, these sensations range in severity from uncomfortable to irritating to painful.</p>\n <p>Trying to relax and lying down activates the symptoms or makes them worse and most people with RLS have difficulty falling asleep and staying asleep. Sufferers are often exhausted with daytime fatigue and sleepiness and many people report that job, personal relations, and activities of daily living are adversly affected as a result of this exhaustion, because they are unable to concentrate, or have impaired memory.</p>\n <p>Prevalence of RLS</p>\n <p>The condition probably affects 5-10% of people, but may be underdiagnosed and, in some cases, misdiagnosed. Some people with RLS will not seek medical attention, believing that they will not be taken seriously, that their symptoms are too mild, or that their condition is not treatable. <strong>Some physicians wrongly attribute the symptoms to nervousness, insomnia, stress, arthritis, muscle cramps, or aging.</strong></p>\n <p>RLS occurs in women and men, probably slightly more often in women. Although the syndrome may begin at any age, even as early as infancy, most patients who are severely affected are middle-aged or older. In addition, severity appears to increase with age with more senior patients experiencing symptoms more frequently and for longer.</p>\n <h2>Symptoms of restless legs</h2>\n <p>People with RLS feel uncomfortable sensations in their legs, especially when sitting or lying down, often more in the evening than the day, with an irresistible urge to move about. Although the sensations can occur on just one side of the body, most often they affect both sides.</p>\n <p>Because moving the legs (or other affected parts of the body) relieves the discomfort, people with RLS often keep their legs moving to reduce the unpleasant sensations. They may pace the floor, constantly move their legs while sitting, and toss and turn in bed.</p>\n <p>Most people find the symptoms to be less noticeable during the day and more pronounced in the evening or at night, especially going to sleep. For many people, the symptoms disappear by early morning, allowing for more refreshing sleep at that time. Other triggering situations are periods of inactivity such as long journeys, or other behaviours that reduce movement.</p>\n <p>The symptoms of RLS vary in severity and duration from person to person. Mild RLS occurs episodically, with only mild disruption of sleep onset, and causes little distress. In moderately severe cases, symptoms occur only once or twice a week but result in significant delay of sleep onset, with some disruption of daytime function. In severe cases of RLS, the symptoms occur more than twice a week and result in burdensome interruption of sleep and impairment of daytime function. There is a standard symptom scoring system.</p>\n <h2>What causes RLS?</h2>\n <p>In most cases, the cause of RLS is unknown (and then doctors call it idiopathic RLS). Family history of the condition is common, perhaps in half the sufferers. People with familial RLS tend to be younger when symptoms start and have a slower progression of the condition.</p>\n <p>In other cases, RLS appears to be related to the following factors or conditions, although researchers do not yet know if these factors actually cause RLS.</p>\n <ul>\n     <li>People with low iron levels or anaemia may be prone to developing RLS. Once iron levels or anaemia is corrected, patients may see a reduction in symptoms. </li>\n     <li>Chronic diseases such as kidney failure, diabetes, Parkinson\'s disease, and peripheral neuropathy are associated with RLS. Treating the underlying condition often provides relief from RLS symptoms. </li>\n     <li>Some pregnant women experience RLS, especially in their last trimester. For most of these women, symptoms usually disappear within four weeks after delivery. </li>\n     <li>Certain medications-such as antinausea drugs (prochlorperazine or metoclopramide), antiseizure drugs (phenytoin or droperidol), antipsychotic drugs (haloperidol or phenothiazine derivatives), and some cold and allergy medications-may aggravate symptoms. Patients can talk with their physicians about the possibility of changing medications. </li>\n </ul>\n <p>How is RLS diagnosed?</p>\n <p>Currently, there is no single diagnostic test for RLS. The disorder is diagnosed clinically by evaluating the patient\'s history and symptoms. In 1995, the International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group identified four basic criteria for diagnosing RLS:</p>\n <ol>\n     <li>a desire to move the limbs, often associated with paresthesias or dysesthesias, </li>\n     <li>symptoms that are worse or present only during rest and are partially or temporarily relieved by activity, </li>\n     <li>motor restlessness, and </li>\n     <li>nocturnal worsening of symptoms. </li>\n </ol>\n <p>A 10-question scoring system is available for RLS diagnosis and severity scoring.</p>\n <p>A more detailed description of diagnostic criteria in adults, children, and cognitively impaired adults is available.</p>\n <h2>How is RLS treated?</h2>\n <p>Relief on movement is generally only temporary. However, RLS can be controlled by finding any possible underlying disorder. Often, treating the associated medical condition, like anaemia, peripheral neuropathy or diabetes, will alleviate many symptoms. For patients with idiopathic RLS, treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms.</p>\n <p>For those with mild to moderate symptoms, prevention is key, and many physicians suggest certain lifestyle changes and activities to reduce or eliminate symptoms. Decreased use of caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco may provide some relief. Doctors may suggest the use of supplements to correct deficiencies in iron, folate, and magnesium. Studies also have shown that maintaining a regular sleep pattern can reduce symptoms. Some individuals, finding that RLS symptoms are lower in the early morning, change their sleep patterns. Others have found that a program of regular moderate exercise helps them sleep better. Taking a hot bath, massaging the legs, or using a heating pad or ice pack can help relieve symptoms in some patients. Although many patients find some relief with such measures, rarely do these efforts completely eliminate symptoms, and for many of these measures there is only anecdotal evidence that they work.</p>\n <p>A variety of drugs have been tried, often not in large or long trials. Some seem to work well in reducing periodic leg movements, or daytime tiredness, or improving sleep, or reducing RLS symptom severity, but there is no magic bullet as yet.</p>\n <p><span style=\"color: #808080\"><span style=\"font-size: small\"><span style=\"font-family: Verdana\"> </span></span></span>The prevalence of RLS is as high as 26% in the months before delivery, but by six months after delivery RLS has disappeared in women who did not have it before pregnancy.</p>\n<h3>Reference</h3>\n <h4>M Manconi et al.

This pushes the start of mankind’s chocolate addiction back by 1,000 years. Prior to that discovery, the earliest signs of cocoa use dated back to 400 A.D.\n\nChocolate\n\nHowever, it’s important to realize the differences between the various types of chocolate products available today.\n\nFor example, there’s a huge difference between the minimally processed dark chocolate and the milk chocolate found in most candy bars.\n\nChocolate drinks\n\nLikewise, raw, unsweetened cocoa powder, which is high in antioxidant flavonols, is vastly different from the common commercial cocoa drinks that are loaded with sugar and low in antioxidant content.\n\nDark Chocolate May Ease Anxiety\n<blockquote><a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/03/23/chocolate-part-three.aspx\">Dark chocolate has previously been linked to a number of health benefits</a>, and according to this latest study, it may even help people suffering from high levels of anxiety to reduce their stress responses.\n\n(It’s worth noting that the study was conducted by a Nestle research group, so there’s potential for bias, but since there’s plenty of other research to back up the benefits of cocoa, their findings are interesting nonetheless.)\n\nThe researchers found that eating 40 grams of dark chocolate (Nestle brand Noir Intense, consisting of 74 percent cocoa solids) every day for two weeks affected the way stress hormones were metabolized.\n\nIn the high anxiety group, eating this amount of dark chocolate significantly reduced stress hormone levels, and the participants in this group also reported feeling less anxious after eating chocolate.\n\nThese findings did not apply to participants in the low anxiety group.\n\nThey explain the results by showing that people with higher levels of anxiety also have a distinctly different metabolic profile.\n\nDark chocolate reduced the urinary excretion of the stress hormone cortisol and catecholamines, and partially normalized stress-related differences in energy metabolism and gut microbial activities.\n\nThis all sounds well and good, however I’d be leery of consuming as much as 40 grams of chocolate each and every day.</blockquote>\n<strong>How Much Chocolate is “Enough”?</strong>\n<blockquote>I say that for a couple of reasons. First, dark chocolate, although lower in sugar than milk chocolate, still contains sugar and can raise your insulin levels. And, as you may know by now, high insulin levels are perhaps the number one cause of disease in general.\n\nIn addition, a <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/10/09/how-much-chocolate-should-you-eat.aspx\">study</a> published last year found that just 6.7 grams of dark chocolate per day -- a bit less than half a bar a week -- represents the ideal amount for a protective effect against inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Any more than that started to cancel out the benefits.\n\nChronic inflammation is a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular diseases ranging from myocardial infarction to stroke.\n\nThe study found that those who ate dark chocolate regularly had an average of 17 percent reduction in C-reactive protein -- enough to decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease by one-third in women and one-fourth in men.\n\nGranted, it may be that more chocolate is required to achieve the anti-anxiety effect discovered above. However, they didn’t check to see if a lesser amount might have done the trick as well, so we just don’t know, do we?\n\nPersonally, I’d advise against eating half a bar of chocolate a day. To me it seems excessive, and may end up doing more harm than good in the long run.</blockquote>\n<strong>Not All Chocolate is Created Equal</strong>\n<blockquote>The health benefits from chocolate are mainly due to the antioxidants present in the cocoa, such as flavonols.\n\nFlavonols are a subclass of flavonoids, which are natural chemicals found in plants, fruits and vegetables.\n\nFlavonoids, in turn, are the largest group of several thousand compounds belonging to the antioxidant-rich polyphenol family (also called phytochemicals). While all flavonoids are antioxidants, some have stronger antioxidant properties than others, depending on their chemical structure.\n\nThe total antioxidant content of chocolate products are directly associated with the amount of raw cocoa it contains.\n\nIt’s no surprise then that cocoa powder ranks number one when it comes to health benefits, as it contains the highest level of flavanol antioxidants.\n\nAccording to a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Journal+of+agricultural+and+food+chemistry%22%5BJour%5D+AND+2009%5Bpdat%5D+AND+Stuart+D%5Bauthor%5D\">study</a> published in the <em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</em> a couple of months ago, in terms of healthy antioxidant content, cocoa powder is followed by:\n<ul>\n	<li>Unsweetened baking chocolate</li>\n	<li>Dark chocolate</li>\n	<li>Semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>\n	<li>Milk chocolate</li>\n</ul>\nIf you’re still tempted to grab milk chocolate, simply because it’s on the list, don’t.\n\nProcessing has a lot to do with whether the chocolate in question has any benefits, and milk chocolate rates very poorly in this regard as it is heavily processed. The typical commercial chocolate has <em>less than half</em> of its flavonoids remaining after processing.\n\nIn addition, milk chocolate contains milk, which cancels out chocolate’s antioxidant effects, according to a study published in the journal <em>Nature</em>. Proteins in the milk bind with the antioxidants, making them less easily absorbed by your body.\n\nAnother concern about processed chocolate is <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/11/17/why-you-must-stay-away-from-processed-chocolate.aspx\">lead content</a>. Researchers have found that commercial chocolate can be contaminated with extremely high quantities of lead. It is currently unknown if this contamination is coming from the shipping or the manufacturing process. Whatever the cause might be, your best bet is to stick with dark, organic, unprocessed chocolate to minimize contamination risk.\n\nThe closer the chocolate is to its original raw state, the better it is for you.</blockquote>\n<strong>The Health Benefits of Pure Cocoa</strong>\n<blockquote>Quite a few studies have confirmed the potent antioxidant properties and subsequent health benefits of raw cocoa powder.\n\nFor example, a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/11/031106051159.htm\">2003 study</a> in the <em>Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry</em> found that a cup of hot cocoa (using pure cocoa powder) had close to double the amount of antioxidants than a glass of red wine, more than double the amount of green tea, and four to five times more than black tea!\n\nLikewise, dark unprocessed chocolate has been exonerated in several studies as actually having some <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2004/06/16/chocolate-health.aspx\">positive impact on your health</a>, such as improving your:\n<ul>\n	<li><a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/03/23/chocolate-part-three.aspx\">Glucose metabolism</a> (diabetic control)</li>\n	<li>Blood pressure</li>\n	<li><a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2005/07/14/chocolate-heart.aspx\">Cardiovascular system</a></li>\n</ul>\nStill, the take-home message of many of these studies is not that you should guzzle cocoa or over-indulge in chocolate, even if it’s dark, but rather, they show that dietary flavonols hold promise as a way to prevent heart disease and normalize glucose metabolism.\n\nThere are many other dietary sources of flavonols in addition to cocoa – sources that are part of a healthy, <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/05/29/how-wild-cheetahs-dying-can-massively-improve-your-health.aspx\">mostly raw</a>, low-sugar diet.</blockquote>\n<strong>Other Sources of Heart-Healthy Flavonols</strong>\n<blockquote>It is important to realize that raw unprocessed cacao, from which chocolate is made, and which is loaded with all these beneficial antioxidants, is actually <em>very bitter</em>. For this reason, well over 95 percent of people don’t enjoy it.\n\nOur team recently put together one of the healthiest chocolate treats on the market so if you are looking for a healthy chocolate snack please, be sure and look at our new <a href=\"http://products.mercola.com/organic-dark-chocolate/\">organic, dark chocolate bar</a>.\n\nIf you do not enjoy chocolate, or want to avoid all sugar, then you can still enjoy the benefits that cocoa and chocolate provides (via flavonols) by consuming fruits and vegetables.\n\n<a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/06/07/fruit-can-keep-your-arteries-squeaky-clean.aspx\">Red grapes, apples</a> and <a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2000/04/23/oranges-iinhiibit-cancer.aspx\">tangerines</a> are high in antioxidants, as are most all vegetables, such as spinach, kale and broccoli.\n\nHowever, as I described in my previous article, <em><a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/06/07/fruit-can-keep-your-arteries-squeaky-clean.aspx\">Fruit Can Keep Your Arteries Squeaky Clean</a></em>, you need to be aware of certain precautions when it comes to eating fruits, and you may need to restrict your fruit intake, especially if you have diabetes.\n\n<a href=\"http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2003/09/24/berries-health.aspx\">Blueberries</a> are the top-rated food by the USDA as far as antioxidant capacity is concerned, and they’re also a safer option if you’re diabetic, as they’re low in sugar.

Potentially, we are each other\\\'s biological enemies or allies....</strong>\n\nBy DANIEL GOLEMAN\nPublished in the New York Times: October 10, 2006\n\nA dear friend has been battling cancer for a decade or more. Through a grinding mix of chemotherapy, radiation and all the other necessary indignities of oncology, he has lived on, despite dire prognoses to the contrary.\n\nMy friend was the sort of college professor students remember fondly: not just inspiring in class but taking a genuine interest in them - in their studies, their progress through life, their fears and hopes. A wide circle of former students count themselves among his lifelong friends; he and his wife have always welcomed a steady stream of visitors to their home.\n\nThough no one could ever prove it, I suspect that one of many ingredients in his longevity has been this flow of people who love him.\n\nResearch on the link between relationships and physical health has established that people with rich personal networks - who are married, have close family and friends, are active in social and religious groups - recover more quickly from disease and live longer. But now the emerging field of social neuroscience, the study of how people\\\'s brains entrain as they interact, adds a missing piece to that data.\n\nThe most significant finding was the discovery of \"mirror neurons,\" a widely dispersed class of brain cells that operate like neural WiFi. Mirror neurons track the emotional flow, movement and even intentions of the person we are with, and replicate this sensed state in our own brain by stirring in our brain the same areas active in the other person.\n\nMirror neurons offer a neural mechanism that explains emotional contagion, the tendency of one person to catch the feelings of another, particularly if strongly expressed. This brain-to-brain link may also account for feelings of rapport, which research finds depend in part on extremely rapid synchronization of people’s posture, vocal pacing and movements as they interact. In short, these brain cells seem to allow the interpersonal orchestration of shifts in physiology.\n\nSuch coordination of emotions, cardiovascular reactions or brain states between two people has been studied in mothers with their infants, marital partners arguing and even among people in meetings. Reviewing decades of such data, Lisa M. Diamond and Lisa G. Aspinwall, psychologists at the University of Utah, offer the infelicitous term \"a mutually regulating psychobiological unit\" to describe the merging of two discrete physiologies into a connected circuit. To the degree that this occurs, Dr. Diamond and Dr. Aspinwall argue, emotional closeness allows the biology of one person to influence that of the other.\n\nJohn T. Cacioppo, director of the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago, makes a parallel proposal: the emotional status of our main relationships has a significant impact on our overall pattern of cardiovascular and neuroendocrine activity. This radically expands the scope of biology and neuroscience from focusing on a single body or brain to looking at the interplay between two at a time. In short, my hostility bumps up your blood pressure, your nurturing love lowers mine. Potentially, we are each other’s biological enemies or allies.\n\nEven remotely suggesting health benefits from these interconnections will, no doubt, raise hackles in medical circles. No one can claim solid data showing a medically significant effect from the intermingling of physiologies.\n\nAt the same time, there is now no doubt that this same connectivity can offer a biologically grounded emotional solace. Physical suffering aside, a healing presence can relieve emotional suffering. A case in point is a functional magnetic resonance imaging study of women awaiting an electric shock. When the women endured their apprehension alone, activity in neural regions that incite stress hormones and anxiety was heightened. As James A. Coan reported last year in an article in Psychophysiology, when a stranger held the subject\\\'s hand as she waited, she found little relief. When her husband held her hand, she not only felt calm, but her brain circuitry quieted, revealing the biology of emotional rescue.\n\nBut as all too many people with severe chronic diseases know, loved ones can disappear, leaving them to bear their difficulties in lonely isolation. Social rejection activates the very zones of the brain that generate, among other things, the sting of physical pain. Matthew D. Lieberman and Naomi Eisenberg of U.C.L.A. (writing in a chapter in \"Social Neuroscience: People Thinking About People,\" M.I.T. Press, 2005) have proposed that the brain’s pain centers may have taken on a hypersensitivity to social banishment because exclusion was a death sentence in human prehistory. They note that in many languages the words that describe a \"broken heart\" from rejection borrow the lexicon of physical hurt.\n\nSo when the people who care about a patient fail to show up, it may be a double blow: the pain of rejection and the deprivation of the benefits of loving contact. Sheldon Cohen, a psychologist at Carnegie-Mellon University who studies the effects of personal connections on health, emphasizes that a hospital patient\\\'s family and friends help just by visiting, whether or not they quite know what to say.\n\nMy friend has reached that point where doctors see nothing else to try. On my last visit, he and his wife told me that he was starting hospice care.\n\nOne challenge, he told me, will be channeling the river of people who want to visit into the narrow range of hours in a week when he still has the energy to engage them.\n\nAs he said this, I felt myself tearing up, and responded: \"You know, at least it\\\'s better to have this problem. So many people go through this all alone.\"\n\nHe was silent for a moment, thoughtful. Then he answered softly, \"You\\\'re right.\"\n\n<em>Daniel Goleman is the author of \"Social Intelligence: The New Science of Human Relationships.\"</em>','nurturing energy','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-04-28 14:11:07','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=450',0,'post','',0),(452,2,'2011-02-15 20:25:02','0000-00-00 00:00:00','','Give me a chance!','','draft','open','closed','','','','','2011-02-15 20:25:02','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=452',0,'post','',0),(466,2,'2012-10-25 17:20:49','2012-10-25 16:20:49','<div class=\"blog_image\"><img title=\"blog_Woman_Legs\" src=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/catalog/view/theme/simplyvital/image/blog_Woman_Legs.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></div>\n<strong>Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS)</strong> is a neurological condition associated with <strong>altered dopamine functioning </strong>within the central nervous system rather than a problem with the legs themselves:\n\n<em>\"The problem lies with the brain messages being sent to the legs and not with the legs themselves. The brain produces <strong>dopamine,</strong> which acts as a messenger for cell receptors... \"</em> says Katie Sidle, Consultant Neurologist, London in an article in The Sunday Mail, January 2010.\n\nRestless legs can occur in younger people and during pregnancy, but occurs more from <strong>mid-life as the level of dopamine in the central nervous system starts to decline</strong>.\n\n<strong>Dopamine</strong> is an important neurotransmitter molecule in the central nervous system vital for the control and coordination of movement. Dopamine also keeps us alert, active and motivated, is necessary for “executive” functions (constructive thinking, concentration and memory formation) and is required to generate pleasurable feelings and sexual desire. From mid-life dopamine levels decline by approximately 13% per decade, accounting for many of the general symptoms of ageing; fatigue, low mood, depression, poor sleep quality, loss of muscle tone and cognitive function.<strong> </strong>\n\n<strong>Support Dopamine Function with QuietLEGS</strong>\n\nA synergistic formula of pure plant extracts, QuietLEGS is rich in phenylethylamine (PEA), the amino acid produced in the brain when we feel happy, joyous and calm. PEA is a neuromodulator and neuroregenerative molecule and is proven to improve mood, concentration and mental acuity and to raise the level of freely circulating dopamine in the brain.\n\nPEA normally has a short half-life in the body when taken orally, but protected by specific anti-oxidant molecules present in QuietLEGS it is able to enter the blood stream, cross the blood brain barrier and help maintain dopamine levels.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/quietlegs\"><strong>QuietLEGS </strong></a> capsules are suitable for vegetarians and vegans.\n\nDosage: 1 or 2 capsules with your evening meal or half an hour bedtime.\n\n<strong>Customer feedback</strong>\n\n\"They really do work!

In 1994 it was described as the ‘the most common disorder you’ve never heard of’, a rather apt phrase as many doctors are still unaware of it. Yet research is proving RLS is a neurological condition involving faulty dopamine functioning within the central nervous system (1,2).\n\nIn the absence of any demonstrable neurology, clinicians often dismiss the seriousness of restless legs, but the effect of sleep disturbance on quality of life should not be underestimated. Often regarded as a psychosomatic disorder, patients are told ‘to put up with it’ and it is not unusual for diagnosis to be delayed by years, with patients becoming severely sleep deprived and depressed.\n\n<strong>RLS is either primary or secondary</strong>\n\n<strong>Primary</strong> RLS is considered idiopathic (no known cause) and usually begins slowly, before 40–45 years of age and may disappear for months or even years. It is often progressive and gets worse with age. RLS in children is often misdiagnosed as \"growing pains\" and the tiredness it creates may result in misdiagnoses of attention deficit disorders.\n\n<strong>Secondary</strong> RLS often has a sudden onset after age 40, and may be daily from the beginning. It is most associated with specific medical conditions i.e. hypothyroidism, anaemia, renal failure, polyneuropathy, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome and amyloidosis.\n\nThe use or withdrawal of certain drugsmay also precipitate RLS (3,4) and pregnancy and hypoglycemia both worsen symptoms (5,6). Both primary and secondary RLS can be worsened by surgery of any kind and back surgery or injury can be associated with actually causing RLS (7). More than 60% of cases of RLS are familial (8).\n\n<strong>Restless Leg Syndrome Treatment</strong>\n\nGenerally, RLS is poorly managed and often inappropriate drugs are prescribed such as benzodiazepines, codeine and quinine, to name a few.\n\nFirst line treatment is considered to be dopamine agonists (drugs that stimulate dopamine receptors) originally developed for Parkinson’s disease* such as pramipexole, ropinirole and rotigotine. However, these drugs can cause augmentation: the drug itself causes symptoms to increase in severity and/or occur earlier in the day. Dopamine agonists may also cause rebound, when symptoms increase as the drug wears off. In many cases, the longer dopamine agonists are used the higher the risk of augmentation and rebound as well as the severity of the symptoms. These problems stem from the over-stimulation of dopamine receptors resulting in desensitization. Side effects include; nausea, light headedness, tiredness, insomnia and increased risk of heart disease.\n\nRecently gabapentin (an epilepsy drug) has received approval for RLS but common side effects in adult patients include dizziness, drowsiness, and swelling of extremities at higher doses in the elderly. Children 3–12 years of age were susceptible to mild-to-moderate mood swings, hostility, concentration problems, and hyperactivity.\n\nPharmacological treatment clearly leaves much to be desired and people are, quite rightly, wary of taking these potent drugs, none of which were developed specifically for RLS nor do they do anything to correct the underlying problem.\n\n*Parkinson\'s disease itself does not seem to increase the risk for RLS nor does RLS early in life predispose a person to Parkinson\'s later on.\n\n<strong>References</strong>\n<ol>\n	<li>Allen, R (2004). \"Dopamine and iron in the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS)\". <strong><em>Sleep Medicine</em></strong> 5 (4): 385–91.</li>\n	<li>Clemens, S.; Rye, D; Hochman, S (2006). \"Restless legs syndrome: Revisiting the dopamine hypothesis from the spinal cord perspective\". <strong><em>Neurology</em> </strong>67 (1): 125–130.</li>\n	<li>Rottach, K; Schaner, B; Kirch, M; Zivotofsky, A; Teufel, L; Gallwitz, T; Messer, T (2008). \"Restless legs syndrome as side effect of second generation antidepressants\". <strong><em>Journal of Psychiatric Research</em></strong> 43 (1): 70–5.</li>\n	<li>Ashton, H (1991). \"Protracted withdrawal syndromes from benzodiazepines\".<strong> <em>Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment</em> </strong>8 (1–2): 19–28.</li>\n	<li>Pantaleo, Nicholas P.; Hening, Wayne A.; Allen, Richard P.; Earley, Christopher J.

It is performed twice yearly; as spring turns to summer and as autumn turns to winter. These times are when our bodies undergo a seasonal shift too, either preparing for the heat of sumer or preparing to \"hibernate\" for winter. Their regime includes:\n\n1. Reducing the amount of food consumed to allow energy to be diverted to cleansing rather than digesting.\n\n2. Eating more seasonal vegetables to provide much needed anti-oxidants, which help to quell the toxins as the are flushed from the cells.\n\n3. Reaching for traditional herbal recipes to support liver function.\n\nOne such recipe is <strong>vitalDETOX. </strong>Made from carefully selected plants that support the liver and gallbladder, this special formula gently cleanses this major detox organ, and when taken over a few weeks promotes:\n<ul>\n	<li>clear eyes and skin</li>\n	<li>steady weight loss</li>\n	<li>higher energy levels</li>\n	<li>a flatter tummy</li>\n	<li>improved digestion and elimination</li>\n</ul>\nThe key is the timing: we are geatly influenced by the seasons and the more we can attune ourselves to the movement of the earth aroud the sun, as we have done for millenia, the more we will enjoy good health.\n\nEnjoy <strong>vitalDETOX</strong> as an aperitif by adding water and lemon juice or add to your favourite fruit juice.

Although there is no causal relationship it suggests that restless legs might be a signal that doctors and patients should pay attention to.\n\nThis was the conclusion drawn from the study by Dr. Arshad Jahangir, a heart rhythm specialist at the Mayo Clinic Arizona in Scottsdale. He led the study and recently presented the results at an American College of Cardiology conference in New Orleans.\n\nRestless legs syndrome is thought to affect millions of people although some doctors think its seriousness has been exaggerated, possibly to help sell treatments. However it has long been known that other types of sleep disturbances such as sleep apnoea carry an accompanying higher risk of heart problems. This study is one of the first to look at how RLS may relate to other aspects of health.\n\nIt involved 584 people diagnosed with the syndrome by a neurologist based on four widely used criteria. Participants were given an imaging test that allowed heart thickness to be measured three ways, and were kept overnight so their sleep could be monitored. Afterward, researchers divided them into two groups based on the frequency of leg twitches. The 45% who twitched at least 35 times per hour were more likely to have the thick-heart condition than the other 55% of study participants who kicked less often. Looking at all study participants about three years later, researchers saw that those with severely thick hearts — about a quarter of the total group — were more than twice as likely to have suffered a heart problem or to have died.\n\n“People with restless legs are advised not to panic, but rather discuss with their doctor whether more tests are needed to look for an enlarged heart” Dr Jahangir said.\n\n<strong>Our comments:</strong>\n\nThe low dopamine that is associated with restless legs, may also lie behind this heart wall thickening since dopamine is necessary for adequate heart function.\n\n<strong>Our recommended product for RLS, vitalCALM</strong>, is also very beneficial for the heart and circulatory system. Not only do the enhanced dopamine levels help the circulatory system function better, the high levels of resveratrol help protect the heart and blood vessels.

And those of us with fair Northern European skins have little natural protection.\n\nPublic health awareness campaigns over the last 20 years have encouraged us to use suncreams  and to wear protective clothing, especially in peak periods in the middle of the day when we are in the sun.\n\n However, we do need some exposure to sunlight as studies researching the association between levels of  vitamin D and various diseases testifies. These studies reveal that there are widespread deficiencies in levels of vitamin D with lack of exposure to sunlight and sunbathing with sunscreens to blame.\n\nVitamin D is essential for a range of metabolic processes, particularly those concerned with bone metabolism - and almost all vitamin D comes from sunlight  (a small amount comes from the diet, but not enough to keep us healthy). And although in most cases the deficiencies are mild, they\'re enough to concern experts working in the field of bone metabolism and bone disease.\n\nGroups most at risk are:\n<ul>\n	<li>Those in colder climes, especially those who work and/or spend a lot of time indoors (especially those living in high-rise apartments without gardens). Many of these people leave for work early in the morning, get home after dark, and don\'t get much sunlight.</li>\n	<li>Children who spend long periods in front of computers and don\'t go outdoors.</li>\n	<li>Dark-skinned immigrants from Africa, India and Pakistan; these people have increased amounts of melanin pigment in the skin that blocks UV light from sunlight, so their bodies don\'t make as much vitamin D as fair-skinned people.</li>\n	<li>People who cover up most of their body - for example Islamic women who wear the veil.</li>\n</ul>\nThose with the highest risk of all are the elderly who are immobile and stay indoors, particularly those in nursing homes and other aged care facilities.\n\nAccording to an editorial in the latest Medical Journal of Australia (where we know they have more sun than most!), nearly a third of men and women have mild to moderate vitamin D deficiency. Almost half of nursing home patients have at least mild Vitamin D deficiency.\n\n<strong>Low levels of Vitamin D can cause:</strong>\n\n-Rickets - a childhood disease in which the bones soften and can become misshapen (in adults the condition is called osteomalacia).\n\n-Osteoporosis - thinning of the bones. Osteoporosis is a major risk factor for hip fractures, especially in the elderly.\n\n-There\'s also evidence that low levels of vitamin D predispose to some cancers - especially cancer of the breast, colon and prostate.\n\nSo how do we keep our vitamin D levels up?  A few foods contain vitamin D - notably, fish with a high fat content  (like sardines, salmon, herring and mackerel), meat and eggs. Some milk and milk products - powdered milk, yoghurts and cheeses - are fortified with vitamin D.  But these foods aren\'t nearly enough to give us adequate vitamin D, according to the experts.\n\n<strong>We need to spend some time in the sun without sunscreens!</strong>\n\nIn March 2006, a group consisting of The Working Group of the Australian and New Zealand Bone and Mineral Society, the Endocrine Society of Australia and Osteoporosis Australia published a position statement in the Medical Journal of Australia. They recommended that people need certain minimal levels of sunlight to get adequate vitamin D levels.  If they\'re at risk of having lower-than-normal levels of vitamin D, they need to increase their sun exposure.\n\n<strong>Skin doctors alarmed..so who\'s right?</strong><strong></strong>\n\nThe Australasian College of Dermatologists is concerned about suggestions that people get more sunlight.   \"Almost all Australians will have enough exposure to the sun to get adequate levels of Vitamin D, simply by being outdoors for short periods of time,\" says Dr Stephen Shumack, the College\'s Honorary Secretary.  \"There\'s no evidence that people who have mildly lower levels of Vitamin D are going to get bone disease. The connection hasn\'t been proved,\" he says.\n\nHe says, “Yes, in some cases, people institutionalised in nursing homes have sub-optimal levels of vitamin D.  They need to be treated with vitamin D supplements.  But to advise healthy Australians to get additional sunlight is potentially dangerous, he argues.\n\n<strong>Avoiding skin cancer risk</strong><strong></strong>\n\nProfessor Rebecca Mason, an expert on vitamin D and calcium metabolism and Professor of Physiology at the University of Sydney, says the recommended levels of sunlight exposure will not put anyone at risk of skin cancer.  Those levels are:\n\n-     in summer, six to eight minutes a day on most days (that\'s about 10-15 minutes in northern Europe)\n\n-     in winter, half an hour most days (make it 1 hour for us!)\n\nYou need to have only 15 per cent of your body exposed - arms, hands and face - to get this exposure. She agrees that most people will already get this amount.  But those people in the at-risk group should make sure they get at least this amount.  People with dark skin may need more.  We need to maintain a balance - we need enough sunlight to keep our bones healthy but not so much that we\'re at risk of skin cancer.\n\n<strong>Precisely!</strong>\n\n<strong>And the problem with suncreams</strong>\n\nis that they encourage over-exposure to the damaging rays of the sun while preventing the good rays from stimulating vitamin D production. The bottom line is that the data shows that those who use suncreams have a higher incidence of skin cancers!\n\n<strong>The golden rules are:</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>start exposing your skin slowly to the sun, 10mins max on day one, 15 the next etc</li>\n	<li>avoid the sun during 11-3pm</li>\n	<li>do not allow yourself to burn</li>\n	<li>protect young skins well with hats etc as children are more vulnerable to burning and evidence links burning in childhood with skin problems later</li>\n	<li>eat lots of carotenoids i.e coloured fruits and veg....see vitalLIFE</li>\n	<li>drink tea as it contains protective molecules too</li>\n</ul>','The suncream debate...','','draft','open','closed','','the-suncream-debate','','','2011-06-10 12:02:43','2011-06-10 11:02:43','',0,'http://www.simplyvital.com/blog/?p=657',0,'post','',0),(659,2,'2010-06-10 12:03:58','2010-06-10 11:03:58','<strong>All men need to look after their prostate gland and improving the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio in the diet may cut prostate cancer risk\n</strong>\n<strong>Over half a million news cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed every year world wide, and the cancer is the direct cause of over 200,000 deaths.</strong>\n\nThe incidence of the disease is also increasing with a rise of 1.7 per cent over 15 years.\n\nHowever a new study lead by researcher Professor William Aronson at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, adds to a growing body of evidence linking an increased <a href=\"javascript:KeywordSearch(\'KEYWORDS=omega-3&amp;period=all&amp;inner=1\');\">omega-3</a> to omega-6 intake ratio to improved health and <strong>prevention of prostate cancer </strong>can now be added to that list.\n\nEarlier this year, researchers from the Paterson Institute, a cancer research institute funded by British charity Cancer Research UK and affiliated with the University of Manchester reported that omega 6 fats increased the spread of prostate tumour cells into bone marrow, while omega-3 fatty acids were seen to block this invasion (British Journal of Cancer, doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603030).  This new research, published in the new issue of the journal Clinical Cancer Research (Vol. 12, Issue 15), suggests that changing the ration of omega-3 to omega-6 in the typical Western diet might reduce prostate cancer tumor growth rates and PSA levels. \n\nProstate specific antigen (PSA) is a protein that is used as a marker for the disease – higher levels are associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer.  A special mouse model was used for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer that is said to closely mirror the disease in humans. The mice were divided into two groups, one fed a diet 20 percent fat with a healthy one-to-one ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, while the second group of mice was fed the same diet but with the fat derived from mostly omega-6 fatty acids.  At the end of the intervention period, the researchers reported that tumour cell growth rates had decreased by 22 per cent and PSA levels by 77 per cent in the group receiving a healthier balance of fatty acids compared with the group that received predominantly omega-6 fatty acids.  “This study strongly suggests that eating a healthier ratio of these two types of fatty acids may make a difference in reducing prostate cancer growth, ,” said Aronson.\n\nOmega 6 fats are found in corn, safflower and other vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and red meats. Corn oil is the backbone of the American diet.  We consume up to 20 times more omega-6 fatty acids in our diet compared to omega-3 acids,” explained Aronson. \n\nThe most likely mechanism for the tumour reductions, say the researchers, is the role of metabolites of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and the omega-6 acid, arachidonic acid.  These three fatty acids compete to be converted by cyclooxgenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) into prostaglandins, which can become either pro-inflammatory and increase tumour growth, or anti-inflammatory and reduce growth.  Aronson and his co-workers found that levels of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin (PGE-2) were 83 per cent lower in tumours in the omega-3 group than in mice on the predominantly omega-6 fatty acid diet.  This suggests that higher levels of DHA and EPA may lead to development of more anti-inflammatory prostaglandins.','Improve omega 3 to 6 ratio to protect the prostate','','publish','open','closed','','improve-omega3-to-6-ratio-to-protect-the-prostate','','','2019-10-16 16:00:31','2019-10-16 15:00:31','',0,'http://www.simplyvital.com/blog/?p=659',0,'post','',0),(708,2,'2012-04-17 11:26:39','0000-00-00 00:00:00','For years the pharmaceutical industry has sold us the idea that depression is simply a lack of serotonin in the brain.

She then started taking 2 <strong><a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/nourish/vitalmacula\">VitalMACULA</a> </strong>capsules daily and when she attended her follow up appointment at Sunderland eye hospital in February 2011, all signs  of her AMD had disappeared!\n\nHer consultant had expected to see a deterioration in her condition but instead could not find any sign of the disease!\n\nThis is only one case of course, but it certainly challenges current assumptions about \"wet\" AMD and treatment options.\n\n<strong>Age-related macular degeneration</strong> (AMD) tends to affect people over 50 resulting in loss of vision in the centre of the visual field (the macula) from damage to the retina. Macular degeneration can make it difficult or impossible to read or recognise faces, although enough peripheral vision remains to allow other activities of daily life.\n\nIn the “dry” (non-exudative) form, cellular debris known as drusen accumulates behind the retina which can then become detached.\n\nIn the “wet” (exudative) form, which is the more severe form, blood vessels grow behind the retina also causing it to become detached. Treatment usually consists of laser coagulation of these vessels or drugs that stop and sometimes reverse blood vessel growth.\n\nThe “dry” form of advanced AMD, results from atrophy to the retinal pigment epithelial layer below the retina, which causes vision loss through loss of photoreceptors in the central part of the eye.\n\nNeovascular or exudative AMD, the “wet” form of advanced AMD, causes vision loss due to abnormal blood vessel growth leading to blood and protein leakage below the macula and accounts for 10% or so of patients with macular degeneration. Bleeding, leaking, and scarring from these blood vessels eventually causes irreversible damage to the photoreceptors and rapid vision loss if left untreated.\n\n<strong>Treatment options</strong>\n\nNo medical or surgical treatment exists for <strong>“dry” AMD</strong>, however experts agree that supplements with high doses of the antioxidants, lutein and zeaxanthin may slow its progression and improve visual acuity.\n\nFor “wet” AMD, drugs such as Lucentis (ranibizumab) aimed at preventing the growth of new blood vessels are injected monthly into the eyes.\n\n<strong>Why is VitalMACULA effective against AMD?</strong>\n\n<strong><a title=\"vitalmax\" href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/nourish-body-and-mind/vitalmax\">VitalMACULA</a> </strong>has an exceptional array of nutrients vital for eye health; amino acids, vitamins, minerals and the pigment molecules lutein, zeaxanthin, chlorophyll, carotenes and phycocyanin, so it is likely that this broad and potent spectrum of nutrients and pigments will support eye health and in the case of this 85 year old lady, helped the eye to heal.\n\nWith the variable success rate of the drug (Lucentis) and the side effects experienced which include: discomfort and increased tears in the affected eye(s), itchy or watery eyes, dry eyes, swelling of the eyelids, blurred vision, sinus pain, sore throat, cough, and joint pain, it seems sensible to try the safe option of <strong>VitalMACULA</strong> first.','Age Related Macular Degeneration','','publish','open','closed','','macular-degeneration-responds-to-vitalmax','','','2011-04-03 22:12:53','2011-04-03 21:12:53','',0,'http://www.simplyvital.com/blog/?p=741',0,'post','',0),(750,2,'2012-05-01 12:04:07','0000-00-00 00:00:00','New treatments for Alzheimers disease include the potential use of medium chain triglycerides (MCT oil) or ketone bodies (also called ketoacids) the end product of MCT metabolism. Ketones may not only treat, but also prevent Alzheimer’s disease. MCTs are found in abundance in virgin coconut oil.\n\nIn 2001, Dr. Richard L. Veech of the NIH, and others, published an article entitled, \"Ketone bodies, potential therapeutic uses.\" In 2003, George F. Cahill, Jr. and Richard Veech authored, \"Ketoacids? Good Medicine?\" and in 2004, Richard Veech published a review of the therapeutic implications of ketone bodies.\n\nOur cells can use ketone bodies as an alternative fuel when glucose is not available. Brain cells, specifically neurons, are very limited, more limited than other cells, in what kinds of fuel they can use to function and to stay alive. The body can produce ketone bodies from coconut oil and when on a very low carb diet. Ketones can serve as food for the brain and nervous system in the event that insulin resistance and a lack of glucose availability develops. Providing the ketone bodies appears to protect the brain cells from destruction.\n\nKetones and ketosis have a bad reputation because of misinformation given during the debate over low carb diets. Dr. Veech has said publicly:\n<blockquote>\"Simply put, ketosis is evolution\'s answer to the thrifty gene. We may have evolved to efficiently store fat for times of famine, says Veech, but we also evolved ketosis to efficiently live off that fat when necessary. Rather than being poison, which is how the press often refers to ketones, they make the body run more efficiently and provide a backup fuel source for the brain. Veech calls ketones \"magic\" and has shown that both the heart and brain run 25 percent more efficiently on ketones than on blood sugar.\"</blockquote>\nIn addition, <strong>one study has shown that ketones trigger a cellular process called chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA).</strong>\n\nWhat is CMA? It is a cellular process that allows cells to remove junk proteins, organelles, and foreign bodies from the watery interior of the cell and deliver them to the cell\'s waste disposal system for degradation. If this \"junk\" isn\'t removed regularly from the cell\'s interior, it eventually overwhelms and kills the cell.\n\nThis line of ketone research is also yielding answers for Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and other neurodegenerative disorders.\n\nRecent research on Alzheimers disease is revealing that <strong>a diet chronically high in carbohydrates and low in dietary cholesterol is associated with the development of a brain based insulin resistance</strong> (now being called Type 3 Diabetes) which can lead to an imbalance in the cellular function and repair mechanisms of the brain.\n\nThe brain is extremely active metabolically, and it is in a constant state of maintaining a balance between the destructive aspects of burning sugar for energy and rebuilding its neurons (brain cells) from incoming cholesterol molecules.\n\nIf blood cholesterol levels fall too low, and blood sugar is chronically high, this delicate balance is upset, and the destruction of the brain cells begins to take the upper hand as oxidative stress increases.\n\nBecause the affected brain lacks enough cholesterol for rebuilding its neuronal cell walls, it substitutes beta-amyloid substances instead. This leads to the buildup of the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimers disease.

It\'s no wonder that the detox regimes started in January fail. In mid-winter your body is in hibernation mode: metabolism is sluggish as the body is trying to conserve fat not release it! It seems obvious when you think about it.\n\nWhen Spring arrives, your body knows it. Just as light brings forth new life in plants it wakes up your metabolism too and if you listen to your body, you will detect that the time is right time to refresh and shed those winter pounds.\n\n<strong>What\'s the fuss about toxins?\n</strong>\n\nIn medicine, the treatment called detoxification is used for dangerous levels of drugs, alcohol, or poisons, like heavy metals. However, our bodies can accumulate many of the everyday toxins we encounter especially if our organs of elimination are not working optimally. Supporting these organs of elimination and becoming aware of the profound effect that the Earth’s energies have on your health, will allow you to achieve better results for your health and weight loss goals.\n\nAt the Spring and Autumn equinoxes your body will have more energy for removing toxins out of your cells. Equinoxes are opposite on either side of the equator, so the Autumn equinox in the Northern Hemisphere is the Spring equinox in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa.\n\nplacing such a huge burden on your liver that it can no longer work as it should: as the major fat burning organ in the body.\n\n<strong>Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) </strong>occurs when fat is not utilised properly and accumulates inside liver cells. An imbalance in the liver’s ability to regulate fat production, distribution, and utilisation is linked to the gradual accumulation of fat in the body.\n\nDetoxification is the body`s ongoing process of neutralising toxins from the tissues and organs of the body and eliminating them via the kidneys, colon, lungs and skin. It\'s the job of the liver to neutralise these toxins, which come both from the work of our metabolism and our environment.\n\nCurrent estimates suggest that there are some 50,000 chemicals in circulation, with 10,000 of these used in food processing and the rest in our personal care and house cleaning products, the air we breathe and the water we drink.\n\nAs the toxic burden on the liver increases, it can no longer function effectively to remove further toxins or burn fat. Toxins then build up in the body causing disruption and damage before eventually being stored mainly in the fat cells of our organs and tissues. Here they can stay for years and <strong>if you hold onto toxins, you hold onto the fat too!</strong>\n\n<strong>Basically, to burn fat, you need a healthy liver!</strong>\n\n<strong>So the first step for weight loss, must be detoxing!</strong>\n\nBy engaging in a \"detoxification programme\" we are actively assisting and supporting the body in its own natural cleansing actions, to help eliminate substances that may be adversly affecting or health and preventing us from losing weight.\nA detox approach that is designed to lower the toxic burden accumulated in our tissues, while supporting the organs of elimination will yield the most effective results for weight loss and health generally.\n\nSuch an approach is possible with <strong><a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/detox-and-shape-up/vitaldetox\">vitalDETOX</a> </strong>a traditional Mediterranean formula that encourages the release of toxins from fat cells while providing the best possible support for your liver as it deals with those toxins.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe word ‘equinox’ means ‘equal day and equal night’. After the autumn equinox, the days get shorter and the nights get longer (and vice versa after the spring equinox).\n\nAt the end of the winter comes the spring equinox, when the body is designed to throw off toxins accumulated during this slower time. You cannot avoid the process that the shift in energy at the equinoxes brings: you will experience a detox whether you are aware of it or not. If you interfere with the process you may establish a whole season of low energy and even ill health. But depending on what you do, you will either move in a direction of greater healing or greater disease. With this knowledge you can ensure it’s the former.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLiver failure can ultimately be the end result of a toxin build up in the liver due to the body not being able to properly process the fructose sugar ingested.\n\nYour body is designed to go through a deep detox at the time of the autumn equinox, and this is its big preparation for winter. During winter the fluids in your body naturally thicken but as long as you’ve gone through this autumn cleanse first, things still stay moving (albeit naturally at a slower rate, due to the season). And If you’re living the standard lifestyle, it’s easy to be completely oblivious to all of this. The cleaner your body is, the more you’ll feel the equinoxes, and if you’re really clean you’ll <em>really</em> feel the full force of the earth’s energy at this time.\n\n“There is a huge surge of energy which detoxifies our cells. […] Our bodies work hard to take full advantage of the high energy of the equinoxes as a means of clearing toxicity. Although the equinoxes are times of potential healing through the removal of a high level of toxicity, they are also potentially times when the body can become overwhelmed and be unable to move on in a positive direction. This could be an inability to fully resolve an acute illness, so symptoms drag on for weeks or months afterwards.”\n\nIf you’ve noticed that many people get colds or ‘flu around the times of the equinoxes, this is why. But if it happens to you, don’t take it as a bad sign. Acute illnesses are the body’s way of throwing off toxicity and they arise when we really need to do that. But that’s not to say that <em>not</em> getting ill at this time is necessarily a sign of health; in some people it’s the very opposite: they are so toxic that their body no longer has the energy to mount a detoxifying acute illness.\n\nMany people who’ve moved to a cleansing lifestyle find that they have the biggest ‘flu they’ve had in their lives at this time of year. Five years ago this happened to me when I started a juice fast and was soon in the midst of my “worst” acute illness ever: a sore throat that lasted three weeks and was so painful it was hard even to sip water or juice. But after that my health and energy recalibrated at a new and higher level: it had been a really major cleansing.\n\nSo if you develop a cold or sore throat at this time, just know that your cells are throwing off a lot of toxicity and that it is especially important that you support this process by taking care of yourself, getting enough rest and eating lightly.\n\nYour cells will throw out a huge amount of toxicity at this time even if you’re not doing anything. But if you don’t support your body through it, your organs of elimination won’t be able to keep up with what’s being thrown at them and sooner or later it will start to back up and get stuck in your bloodstream.\n\nThis will cause your blood sugar to drop and you’ll find yourself strongly pulled back into any past patterns of addictive behaviour, whether that’s to sugar, caffeine or harder drugs. Succumb to temptation and you’ll only become more blocked and may set the stage for a very low winter, or even for a chronic illness.\n\nYou can avoid going down this road by being aware of the massive effort your body is making right now to throw off toxicity, and supporting it in its efforts to do so.\n\nThe secrets to doing that are:\n<ol>\n	<li>Centre your diet around alkalising whole foods, especially vegetable juices, green smoothies, raw soups and salads.</li>\n	<li>Get plenty of rest to leave your body maximum energy for its cleansing endeavours. Most importantly, aim to be in bed by 9pm every night, and asleep by 10 as your organs of elimination require those two hours of sleep before midnight in order to function optimally.</li>\n	<li>Consider a period on just raw juice for a deeper detox in the run-up to the equinox.</li>\n</ol>\nAs Elson M. Haas, M.D. writes in <em>Staying Healthy With the Seasons, </em>“A week of so of juice cleansing in early autumn will give you a boost of energy and may eliminate any potential illnesses you have stored away, either by flushing out excesses or by improving organ functions.”\n\nIf you’ve never experimented with a raw juice only regime before, why not try it on the day of the equinox itself. The next step up would be that day and a day either side. And if you’re an experienced juice faster and in good health, then a juice only regime for several days before and after the equinox will really set you up for the coming season.\n\nAnd even if a juice-only regime isn’t for you, add a daily green juice to your alkalising diet: it will be profoundly powerful in helping your body pull that toxicity out of your cells.\n\nThe take-home message here is that you can’t avoid the autumn (or spring) clean. The shift in energy that takes place at the equinoxes will throw toxicity out of your cells whether you like it or not. But depending on what you do, you will either move in a direction of greater healing or greater dis-ease – and with a little knowledge, planning and effort it’s easy to make sure it’s the former.\n\n<em> </em>','Detox in Spring','','draft','open','closed','','attune-with-nature-for-optimal-health-and-weight-loss','','','2012-05-04 12:24:19','2012-05-04 11:24:19','',0,'http://www.simplyvital.com/blog/?p=787',0,'post','',0),(792,2,'2012-05-01 10:49:22','2012-05-01 09:49:22','<h3>Cosmetics have been found to make breast cancer more aggressive and fatal</h3>\nCosmetics play a key role in the development of aggressive forms of breast cancer accordng to a new study from America.

It is necessary for “executive” functions such as constructive thinking, concentration and memory formation.</strong>\n\nSo, when we feel that dopamine levels may be low, supplementing with Klamath, the richest natural source of the PEA molecule is a good idea. Indeed, various studies show that PEA supplementation improves conditions where dopamine levels are known to be low. For example giving 10-60mg of PEA alone was able to cure 60% of clinically diagnosed depressions (1). (It is in fact dopamine rather than serotonin that is implicated in depression and low mood.)\n\nResearch has also shown that Klamath algae, and especially a specific PEA-rich extract, contain enough PEA to promote better mood, relieve stress and anxiety, help with moderate to serious depressions, as well as problems with concentration(2). In fact, PEA has been named the \"molecule of love\" due to its increased production in states of intense concentration, joyful activities and of course falling in love (3).\n\nWe recommend taking <strong><a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/nourish/vitalmax\">VitalMAX</a></strong> daily to boost dopamine levels thereby helping teens and others of course who are struggling with concentration problems.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">References</span>\n\n1.

It came upon her when she was sitting still for a long while – such as on long car journey or when at the cinema – and at night as she tried to relax to go to sleep.\n\nLesley, 44, is an active lady.  She works as a fitness instructor and is mum to three children aged 9, 11 and 13.\n\nHer involuntary leg twitching is more commonly known as Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).  And while doctors accept it is a condition, there is little they know about it and less they can do about it.  Lesley\'s GP was baffled as to what to do.  Then Lesley read in a fitness magazine about a supplement that could help with RLS: <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalmax\"><strong>vitalMAX</strong></a>.  The article suggested this product could help by increasing the level of dopamine – a neurotransmitter in the brain that, among other things, is responsible for co-ordination and the control of movement.  Tentative studies have linked a lack of dopamine to RLS.\n\nLesley was at her wits\' end so decided to give <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalmax\"><strong>vitalMAX</strong></a> a try.  Within a month her RLS was significantly reduced.\n\nLesley\'s mother, 67, has suffered from RLS for nearly 10 years.  Her condition was more pronounced than Lesley\'s to the point where she started to worry and panic when sitting in confined spaces: long car journeys, a trip to the cinema and a leisurely meal were all out of the question. Added to all this, she never slept well. Alas, her GP in Reading could offer no advice.\n\nHaving enjoyed the benefits of <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalmax\"><strong>vitalMAX</strong></a> Lesley introduced her Mum to it – and her symptoms have cleared completely!  This has a made a huge difference to her. As an active grandma with three daughters and seven grandchildren, her life has been enhanced greatly by solving this problem.\"RLS is very uncomfortable and you can\'t control it at all,\" says Lesley.  \"I admit it sounds stupid and other people can\'t understand what it feels like.  But they certainly get annoyed if you\'re sitting near them when it kicks off! \"Trying to sit still is the hardest thing and some nights it was almost impossible to get to sleep – or stay asleep.  It really did affect my lifestyle and it was such a relief to find <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalmax\"><strong>vitalMAX</strong></a>.  Finally I can sit still, relax, sleep well – and take the family to see a long film at the cinema.\"\n\nLesley takes two capsules each day and this holds her RLS in check.  She did run out of the supplement once and within a couple of days her RLS was back to full force.  As soon as she took <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalmax\"><strong>vitalMAX</strong></a> it calmed back down again. In addition, Lesley reports feeling really well on <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalmax\"><strong>vitalMAX</strong></a>.  She used to suffer from colds and minor illnesses but since taking it she hasn\'t suffered at all.  And now she feels much happier in herself.  Previously, her mood was a lot lower for much of the time.\n\nAll these benefits are not surprising as <strong><a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalmax\">vitalMAX</a> is powerful nutrition for both the mind and body</strong>. In particular it has a high concentration of phenylethylamine (PEA) – a neuroamine known as the \'love molecule\' since it is the molecule we produce when we feel love, joy and calm. PEA is able to lift depressions and improve mood and concentration: as it has proved with Lesley.\n\n\"I confess when Mum started to suffer from RLS I used to think \'what\'s she on about?\'\", admits Lesley. \"Having suffered too, it\'s no laughing matter and is, in fact, very challenging to live with.  I\'m so pleased to have found <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalmax\"><strong>vitalMAX</strong></a> and to be able to help my Mum too.  She lives in Reading – a good five hour car journey away.  You can imagine how difficult it was to see each other with us both suffering with RLS.

It differs from other micro-algae such as Chlorella and Spirulina, insofar as it grows wild in an optimal environment allowing it to develop a truly remarkable nutritional profile.  That environment is Upper Klamath Lake, the largest freshwater lake in Oregon.  The lake is constantly replenished by snow and water runoff from one of the most highly active volcanic regions in the world and this unique source of pure rich mineral water at high altitude, together with a great opportunity for photosynthesis (300 days of sun per year) and cold winters forcing the algae to produce truly essential fatty acids, create what many scientists consider: <strong>the most nutrient abundant food source on our planet!</strong>\n\n<strong>By virtue of its ability to replenish nutritional deficiencies, AFA is capable of:</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li> delaying/reversing premature ageing</li>\n	<li>repairing cell damage</li>\n	<li>improving mental focus and concentration</li>\n	<li>increasing energy and sense of well-being</li>\n	<li>boosting the immune system</li>\n	<li>promoting growth of strong nails, smooth skin, and healthy hair</li>\n	<li>normalising blood-sugar levels</li>\n	<li>supporting digestion and healthy intestinal flora</li>\n	<li>stabilising mood swings and lifting mild to moderate depression</li>\n	<li>clarifying and sharpening eyesight</li>\n	<li>promoting a healthy blood lipid profile</li>\n	<li>increasing endurance and strength</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>It is capable of delivering these benefits by presenting over 70 nutrients in an organic, highly absorbable form:</strong>\n\n<strong>28 Minerals and oligoelements</strong> - Klamath algae is the only food to contain the full range of minerals and trace elements needed to keep the human body fully functional.\n\n<strong>14 Vitamins</strong> - the complete and balanced spectrum.  It is an excellent source of B vitamins, guaranteeing over 200% RDA of the increasingly elusive B12, in just 1 gram!  (1).\n\n<strong>20 Amino Acids</strong> - including all the essential ones in a proportion almost identical to that considered ideal for the human body (Food and Nutrition Council, 1980).  AFA improves the body\'s ability to absorb and utilise proteins from food, making it extremely important for children, adolescents, athletes and anyone wishing to optimise protein metabolism (2).\n\n<strong>Antioxidants</strong> - as well as being extremely rich in anti-oxidant pigments, Klamath algae has a broad range of 15 carotenoids in their natural alpha and gamma forms.  And as science has now definitively shown, only this natural spectrum of carotenoids is capable of true anti-oxidant and anti-cancer activity (3).\n\n<strong>Essential Fatty Acids</strong> - Klamath algae has an excellent profile of EFAs and is one of the richest vegetable sources of Omega-3 and Omega-6 in proportions considered optimal for human consumption (2:1).  (Other algae such as Spirulina and Chlorella have practically no Omega-3). This high quality Omega-3 is important for health and low levels in the diet are associated with raised LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (4).\n\n<strong>Nutraceutical Molecules</strong> - AFA is rich in specific molecules: Phycocyanins - powerful anti-oxidant/anti-inflammatory molecules, Phenylethylamine - a brain amino acid directly responsible for increasing the activation and transmission of important neuro-transmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine, and Polysaccharides - shown to be potent immunomodulators (5).\n\n<strong>Chlorophyll</strong> - AFA has a very high concentration of chlorophyll, which contributes to the cleansing and detoxification of the blood.  Recent studies confirm that dietary sources of chlorophyll have anti-tumor and hepatoprotective actions (6).\n<h2>RECENT STUDIES CONFIRM THE HEALING POWER OF AFA</h2>\nThe health benefits of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae (AFA) have been reported for more than two decades and the clinical evidence base supporting its role in health promotion is growing:\n<h3>Inflammation</h3>\nA review of cases with proven clinical records by a panel of five physicians from the University of Illinois established a therapeutic ability of the algae in relation to: inflammatory and osteoarthritic conditions, fibromyalgia, allergies both nutritional and respiratory, neurological conditions such as depression and attention deficit disorders (7).\n<h3>High Cholesterol and Triglycerides</h3>\nKlamath algae has been shown to rapidly normalise the metabolism of fats contributing to a significant reduction in cholesterol and triglycerides (6).  A recent study performed at the University of Urbino in Italy, using Klamath algae and Phycoplus® (phycocyanin extract) confirmed this lipid lowering effect along with a significant reduction in lipid oxidation, the basis of cardiovascular and hepatic diseases and cell ageing (8).\n<h3>Hypoglycaemia, Diabetes and Obesity</h3>\nAFA has been proven to inhibit the pancreatic production of alpha-amylase, thereby decreasing excessive glycaemic levels and to partially inhibit the intestinal activity of two enzymes, sucrase and maltase, which are responsible for the assimilation of sugars into the bloodstream.  Together these findings show how AFA can contribute to the resolution of the famed Syndrome X, that combination of excessive glycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia which is at the root of today\'s metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, diabetes and obesity (9).\n\nNB Loss of control of blood fats and sugar causes rapid physical and mental ageing!\n<h3>Stress, Depression, Anxiety</h3>\nDisorders such as depression, anxiety and attention deficit disorders figure prominently in the retrospective study quoted earlier.  Until recently, Klamath algae\'s ability to improve stress and nervous conditions was attributed to its general nutritional properties.  But lately, it has been discovered that Klamath algae, if processed using the Refractance Window® technology, contains a significant amount of phenylethylamine (PEA), a brain amino acid directly responsible for increasing the activation and transmission of important neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine.  Supplementation with 10-60mg of PEA was able to cure 60% of clinically diagnosed depressions (10).  Klamath algae, and especially a specific algae extract-Phycoplus®, contain enough PEA to promote better mood, relieve stress, help with moderate to serious depressions, and possibly solve problematic yet still not clearly diagnosed conditions such as ADHD (11).  Indeed, PEA has been named the \"love molecule\" due to its increased endogenous production in states such as intense concentration, joyful activities and love (12).\n\nAnother extraordinary discovery is the ability of AFA to stimulate stem cell release and migration, making AFA the first natural compound known to stimulate the natural innate phenomenon of healing, regeneration and repair in the human body.\n\n<strong>References</strong>\n\n1.

Read how one customer found welcome relief with <strong><a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalwoman\">VitalWOMAN</a></strong> after <strong>suffering for over ten years and having tried everything else...</strong>\n\nArticle as printed in Chat magazine:\n\nSheila Buckley, 58, suffered from severe night sweats and daytime hot flushes – then she discovered <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalwoman\">VitalWOMAN</a>.\n\nMarried with grown up children, Sheila works as a telephonist and lives in Bradford, West Yorkshire. She has suffered from hot flushes and night sweats for nearly 10 years. Initially the daytime hot flushes were most troublesome. Then, about four years ago, Sheila started to suffer from night sweats that were so bad she barely slept and her bed was soaked through night after night.\n\n\"Everyone tells you that hot flushes and night sweats are part and parcel of the menopause so I thought I\'d just have to put up with it,\" says Sheila. \"I did try HRT for a short while but felt awful on it. I didn\'t know what else to do: in the end I took antihistamines to help me sleep as the lack of sleep was as bad as being so wet and uncomfortable.\"\n\nThen a friend recommended Sheila try a new supplement called <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalwoman\">VitalWOMAN</a> which is a completely natural nutritional/herbal preparation that aims to minimise the many menopause miseries, including hot flushes and night sweats.\n\n\"I\'ll try anything once and especially if it\'s natural,\" says Sheila. She started to take <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalwoman\">VitalWOMAN</a> at the beginning of September. \"I can honestly say within days my night sweats abated and my daytime hot flushes became just occasional.\n\n\"Before <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalwoman\">VitalWOMAN</a> I used to line my bed with bath towels to soak up the sweats and my hair would be dripping wet. I awoke several times each night and found it difficult to get comfortable. Each morning there\'d be watermarks on the bedding - I was forever changing the sheets!\n\n\"My husband and I have always slept like spoons but these last few years have made that impossible.

Women who suffer badly during the menopause produce significantly reduced levels of oestrogen that is a key contributor to the various unpleasant symptoms. The isoflavones in <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalwoman\">VitalWOMAN</a> act as a very weak oestrogen but their influence is strong enough to produce oestrogenic effects and so reduce the symptoms of the menopause.\n\nThe other important ingredient in <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalwoman\">VitalWOMAN</a> is Klamath blue green algae which provides a rich supply of nutrients to deeply nourish body and mind and support hormone production. The plant Cimicifuga acts positively against hot flushes, cold sweats, mood swings and sleep disturbances and Angelica helps to regulate blood circulation generally.

INSERT INTO `wp_posts` VALUES (986,2,'2012-08-05 14:07:47','2012-08-05 13:07:47','Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter molecule in the central nervous system enabling information flow between cells. Vital for the control and coordination of movement, dopamine is also involved in keeping us alert, active and motivated. It is necessary for \"executive\" functions such as constructive thinking, concentration and memory formation. Dopamine is also required for the generation of pleasurable feelings and sexual desire and it has a positive effect on the heart, circulation and metabolic rate. Scientific studies link low dopamine levels/function with:\n<ul>\n	<li>anxiety and depression</li>\n	<li>cravings and addictions</li>\n	<li>fibromyalgia</li>\n	<li>obesity</li>\n	<li>Parkinson\'s disease</li>\n	<li>Restless Legs Syndrome</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dopamine receptors</h2>\nAt least five different dopamine receptors (D1-D5) have been identified across the nervous system and it seems that the density and variety of receptors we each have vary considerably depending on our genetic tendency and our development in the womb and during childhood.\n\nDopamine levels and functioning reflect our individual receptor repertoire and are reduced by stress, lack of the right nutrients, ageing and certain medications. Additionally, from mid-life, dopamine levels start declining at a rate of approximately 13% each decade, which accounts for many of the general symptoms of ageing such as fatigue, poor sleep quality, reduced emotional activity, depression, reduced motor activity, loss of muscle tone and cognitive function etc.\n\n<strong>In women</strong>, low dopamine levels in mid-life exacerbate the physiological and psychological effects of declining oestrogen, producing more severe hot flushes, night sweats, sleep disturbances and mood swings.\n\n<strong>For men</strong>, the effects of falling testosterone such as; decreasing muscle mass, increasing body fat, reduced physical energy/endurance, gradually decreasing libido, loss of bone density, increasing cholesterol etc are all exacerbated by declining dopamine.\n\n<strong>Emotionally, dopamine is required to generate:</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>feelings of pleasure</li>\n	<li>feelings of attachment and love</li>\n	<li>a sense of altruism (unselfish concern for the welfare of others)</li>\n	<li>integration of thoughts and feelings</li>\n</ul>\n<strong>and low dopamine may be associated with:</strong>\n<ul>\n	<li>anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure)</li>\n	<li>difficulty in feeling love and sensing attachment to another</li>\n	<li>difficulty in accessing and expressing real feelings</li>\n	<li>a lack of remorse about actions</li>\n	<li>distractibility</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Dopamine and depression</h2>\nThe adult brain is formed from our experiences in childhood and it has been shown that early social deprivation or stress can lead to permanent reduction in dopaminergic neurones especially in the prefrontal cortex of the brain where they are usually very dense, affecting the capacity for positive emotionality. An unsatisfactory early relationship between mother and child for example, results in fewer dopamine receptors and a constricted capacity for pleasure and reward in later life, increasing the propensity of depressive episodes.\n\nThe newer pharmacological teatments for depression are known as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). The basis for their use is that depression is caused by low serotonin levels n the brain. SSRIs work by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin back into the nerve cell, thereby increasing the level existing at the synaptic cleft. However, this entire approach to treating depression is now in question and the drug companies promoting these SSRIs for years are now focussing their research efforts towards the wider role of dopamine.   \n<h2>Improving dopamine levels/functioning</h2>\nConventional medicine treats tonditions associated with low dopamine levels/function with dopamine agonists - drugs that stimulate dopamine receptors. Unfortunately, in time, this constant and unnatural high level of stimulation desensitises the dopamine receptors so that drug effectiveness declines with time and drug dosages then need to be increased. This further desensitises the receptors (which are already in short supply) and increases negative side effects.\n<h2>Improve dopamine levels naturally</h2>\nDopamine is made in the body from the amino acid tyrosine which is derived from the proteins we eat or from the amino acid phenylalanine. Unfortunately, eating more tyrosine-rich foods does not automatically confer higher dopamine levels.\n\nHowever a proven way to improve dopamine levels is with <strong>phenylethylamine</strong> (PEA) (1).\n\nPEA is a molecule we produce endogenously (made in the body) and which is known to have specific neuro-regenerating properties. We produce PEA when we feel happy, joyous and calm. People in love have particularly high levels (hence it has been coined the \"love molecule\") as do long-distance runners - partly explaining the anti-depressant effect of exercise. \n\nImportantly, PEA also has the ability to <strong>raise the level of freely circulating dopamine in the brain.</strong>\n\nProducts containing significant quantities of PEA able to access the central nervous system to positively influence low or declining dopamine levels/function include: <strong>Klamath flakes, MEMaid, QuietLEGS, VitalCALM, VitalLIFT, VitalMAX and VitalWOMAN.</strong>\n\nIf you would like any further information on any of these products or to seek advice from our pharmacist, please call free on 07748312313 between 10-4pm, Monday-Friday.\n\nReferences\n\n1) Murata M., Katagiri N., Ishida K., et al., Effect of beta-phenylethylamine on extracellular concentrations of  dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex.

The brain produces dopamine, which acts as a messenger for cell receptors... \" says Katie Sidle, Consultant Neurologist at a London hospital in an article that appeared in The Sunday Mail in January 2010.\n\n(<a href=\"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/Simply_Vital_Restless_Legs_article_in_MOS2_17.1.10.pdf\">Full news article in pdf form</a>)\n\nAlthough restless legs can occur in younger people and during pregnancy, it appears more frequently with passing years and it is interesting to note that from mid-life the level of dopamine in the central nervous system declines by approximately 13% each decade. This decline accounts for many of the general symptoms of ageing; poor sleep quality, reduced muscle tone, low mood and motivation, stooped posture and the development or worsening of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS).\n\nDrugs which stimulate dopamine receptors (the same drugs used for Parkinson\'s disease) are now prescribed for RLS, but these drugs have many unwanted effects and their efficacy reduces over time.\n\nA healthy way to improve dopamine functioning and calm restless legs however, is with phenylethylamine (PEA), a molecule we produce naturally in the nervous system when we feel happy, calm and joyful and found in two natural foods; raw unprocessed cocoa and Klamath blue-green algae.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalcalm\">vitalCALM</a> contains high levels of PEA and other natural, nourishing ingredients proven to support dopamine levels/functioning. <a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalcalm\">vitalCALM</a> is the healthy choice for restless legs sufferers and anyone wishing to improve dopamine levels/functioning.  £47.99 - 120 capsules (a 6-8 week course)\n\nSometimes called a neurohormone, PEA has specific neuro-regenerating properties itself, increasing brain attention, mental acuity and improving mood. People in love generate high quantities of PEA (hence it is aso known as the \"love molecule\") as do long-distance runners, partly explaining the anti-depressant effect of endurance exercise.\n\nFound in significant quantities in only two foods (AFA algae and raw unprocessed cocoa), PEA is able to cross the blood/brain barrier to reach the central nervous system where it increases dopaminergic activation and transmission.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalcalm\">vitalCALM</a> is a new product specifically formulated with concentrated extracts of PEA from AFA algae, ginger root extract, grape extract with a high concentration of resveratrol (both shown to support dopamine functioning) and organic minerals. It is effective in alleviating Restless Legs Syndrome as well as other conditions associated with altered dopamine levels and functioning such as low mood, anxiety, depression, fatigue, low libido, and insomnia.\n\n<a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/vitalcalm\">vitalCALM</a> offers a drug-free alternative for RLS, and in addition provides advanced nutritional support for the mind and body supporting cardiovascular, immune and respiratory systems.\n\nRead more about dopamine in the article: <a href=\"/blog/2010/12/increase-dopamine-levels-naturally\">Increase Dopamine Levels Naturally</a>','Restless Legs Run in the Brain','','publish','open','closed','','restless-legs-run-in-the-brain','','','2010-10-29 14:18:13','2010-10-29 13:18:13','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=203',0,'post','',0),(988,2,'2010-07-13 10:45:10','2010-07-13 09:45:10','<a href=\"/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Natural_Health_120710265.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-296\" title=\"Natural_Health_120710265\" src=\"/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Natural_Health_120710265.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"504\" height=\"865\" /></a>','07/10 Natural toothcare products - NATURAL HEALTH','','publish','open','closed','','0710-natural-toothcare-products-natural-health','','','2010-07-13 10:45:10','2010-07-13 09:45:10','',0,'http://www.palsports.co.uk/cms/?p=295',0,'post','',0),(989,1,'2019-10-16 15:56:28','2019-10-16 14:56:28','<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Welcome to WordPress.

If blood cholesterol levels fall too low, and blood sugar is chronically high, this delicate balance is upset, and the destruction of the brain cells begins to take the upper hand as oxidative stress increases.\n\nBecause the affected brain lacks enough cholesterol for rebuilding its neuronal cell walls, it substitutes beta-amyloid substances instead. This leads to the buildup of the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimers disease.

The culprit is the heavy metal cadmium found in most non-organic make-up and cosmetic products. Long-term exposure to the heavy metal seems to helps the cancer spread.\n\nMaggie Louie, a professor of biochemistry at Dominican University of California says, \" Cadmium doesn’t necessarily cause cancer – but it makes it more aggressive. And 90 per cent of breast cancer deaths are those that have spread to other areas of the body.\"\n\nCadmium is a by-product of mining and refining zinc, copper and lead and is present in our food, water, and air, but women are almost constantly exposed to low levels of the metal via their make-up.\n\n<strong>Reference</strong>\n\nAmerican Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, April 23, 2012\n\nWomen may unknowingly be harming themselves by using widely available and heavily promoted standard ranges of cosmetics and make-up.\n\nProtect yourself by swapping dangerous brands for safe ones starting with your lipsticks since these products mostly end up being swallowed and are therefore the most dangerous make-up category!\n\nCheck out our exciting new range of <strong><a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/lips\">100% pure lipsticks</a> </strong>made with organic ingredients and coloured with plant (fruit and vegetable) pigments that highlights your beauty while protecting your health!','Cosmetics and breast cancer','','inherit','closed','closed','','792-revision-v1','','','2019-10-16 16:00:19','2019-10-16 15:00:19','',792,'http://simplyvital.test/2019/10/16/792-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1000,1,'2019-10-16 16:00:31','2019-10-16 15:00:31','<strong>All men need to look after their prostate gland and improving the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio in the diet may cut prostate cancer risk\n</strong>\n<strong>Over half a million news cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed every year world wide, and the cancer is the direct cause of over 200,000 deaths.</strong>\n\nThe incidence of the disease is also increasing with a rise of 1.7 per cent over 15 years.\n\nHowever a new study lead by researcher Professor William Aronson at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, adds to a growing body of evidence linking an increased <a href=\"javascript:KeywordSearch(\'KEYWORDS=omega-3&amp;period=all&amp;inner=1\');\">omega-3</a> to omega-6 intake ratio to improved health and <strong>prevention of prostate cancer </strong>can now be added to that list.\n\nEarlier this year, researchers from the Paterson Institute, a cancer research institute funded by British charity Cancer Research UK and affiliated with the University of Manchester reported that omega 6 fats increased the spread of prostate tumour cells into bone marrow, while omega-3 fatty acids were seen to block this invasion (British Journal of Cancer, doi: 10.1038/sj.bjc.6603030).  This new research, published in the new issue of the journal Clinical Cancer Research (Vol. 12, Issue 15), suggests that changing the ration of omega-3 to omega-6 in the typical Western diet might reduce prostate cancer tumor growth rates and PSA levels. \n\nProstate specific antigen (PSA) is a protein that is used as a marker for the disease – higher levels are associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer.  A special mouse model was used for hormone-sensitive prostate cancer that is said to closely mirror the disease in humans. The mice were divided into two groups, one fed a diet 20 percent fat with a healthy one-to-one ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 fatty acids, while the second group of mice was fed the same diet but with the fat derived from mostly omega-6 fatty acids.  At the end of the intervention period, the researchers reported that tumour cell growth rates had decreased by 22 per cent and PSA levels by 77 per cent in the group receiving a healthier balance of fatty acids compared with the group that received predominantly omega-6 fatty acids.  “This study strongly suggests that eating a healthier ratio of these two types of fatty acids may make a difference in reducing prostate cancer growth, ,” said Aronson.\n\nOmega 6 fats are found in corn, safflower and other vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, and red meats. Corn oil is the backbone of the American diet.  We consume up to 20 times more omega-6 fatty acids in our diet compared to omega-3 acids,” explained Aronson. \n\nThe most likely mechanism for the tumour reductions, say the researchers, is the role of metabolites of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and the omega-6 acid, arachidonic acid.  These three fatty acids compete to be converted by cyclooxgenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) into prostaglandins, which can become either pro-inflammatory and increase tumour growth, or anti-inflammatory and reduce growth.  Aronson and his co-workers found that levels of the pro-inflammatory prostaglandin (PGE-2) were 83 per cent lower in tumours in the omega-3 group than in mice on the predominantly omega-6 fatty acid diet.  This suggests that higher levels of DHA and EPA may lead to development of more anti-inflammatory prostaglandins.','Improve omega 3 to 6 ratio to protect the prostate','','inherit','closed','closed','','659-revision-v1','','','2019-10-16 16:00:31','2019-10-16 15:00:31','',659,'http://simplyvital.test/2019/10/16/659-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(1001,0,'2019-10-16 16:01:22','2019-10-16 15:01:22','[\"wc_admin_update_0201_order_status_index\"]','woocommerce_run_update_callback','','pending','open','closed','','','','','2019-10-16 16:01:22','2019-10-16 15:01:22','',0,'http://simplyvital.test/?post_type=scheduled-action&p=1001',0,'scheduled-action','',1),(1002,0,'2019-10-16 16:01:23','2019-10-16 15:01:23','[\"wc_admin_update_0201_db_version\"]','woocommerce_run_update_callback','','pending','open','closed','','','','','2019-10-16 16:01:23','2019-10-16 15:01:23','',0,'http://simplyvital.test/?post_type=scheduled-action&p=1002',0,'scheduled-action','',1),(1003,0,'2019-10-16 16:01:22','2019-10-16 15:01:22','[]','wc_admin_unsnooze_admin_notes','','pending','open','closed','','','','','2019-10-16 16:01:22','2019-10-16 15:01:22','',0,'http://simplyvital.test/?post_type=scheduled-action&p=1003',0,'scheduled-action','',1),(1004,1,'2019-10-16 16:05:42','2019-10-16 15:05:42','<!-- wp:html -->\n<h3>Klamath blue-green algae and specifically, a concentrated extract from the algae rich in phenylethylamine (PEA) helps young minds focus</h3>\nUntil recently, Klamath algae\'s ability to improve stress and nervous conditions was attributed to its general nutritional properties, however it has been shown that it is the the <strong>phenylethylamine (PEA)</strong> molecule within the algae that we can thank for the positive outcomes seen in trials.\n\nThis specific molecule helps increase the activation and transmission of dopamine, an important molecule in the central nervous system enabling information flow between cells. <strong>Vital for the control and coordination of movement, dopamine keeps us alert, active and motivated. It is necessary for “executive” functions such as constructive thinking, concentration and memory formation.</strong>\n\nSo, when we feel that dopamine levels may be low, supplementing with Klamath, the richest natural source of the PEA molecule is a good idea. Indeed, various studies show that PEA supplementation improves conditions where dopamine levels are known to be low. For example giving 10-60mg of PEA alone was able to cure 60% of clinically diagnosed depressions (1). (It is in fact dopamine rather than serotonin that is implicated in depression and low mood.)\n\nResearch has also shown that Klamath algae, and especially a specific PEA-rich extract, contain enough PEA to promote better mood, relieve stress and anxiety, help with moderate to serious depressions, as well as problems with concentration(2). In fact, PEA has been named the \"molecule of love\" due to its increased production in states of intense concentration, joyful activities and of course falling in love (3).\n\nWe recommend taking <strong><a href=\"http://www.simplyvital.com/nourish/vitalmax\">VitalMAX</a></strong> daily to boost dopamine levels thereby helping teens and others of course who are struggling with concentration problems.\n\n<span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">References</span>\n\n1.

transition from being a sugar to a fat burner, which is the key to lasting weight loss and optimal health. Additionally the active plant extracts in VitalTONE improve the micro-circulation and reduces the accumulation of lipids and toxins in fat cells. The result is to detox, slim, tone and smooth the tissues gently but effectively.\r\n\r\n<strong>Directions:</strong> Take 30 drops in water/juice before food 3 times a day.\r\n\r\n2 x 50ml bottles = a 20 day course which can be continued/repeated as necessary\r\n<h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\nOrganic plant extracts of Rosemary, Watercress, Mint, Juniper, Hyssop and Chicory.\r\n<h2>Some other tips to tone up</h2>\r\n<h3>Body brushing</h3>\r\nUsing a dry body brush before you bathe helps improves circulation and lymph flow. Be sure to always brush towards the heart.\r\n<h3>Intermittent fasting</h3>\r\nThis helps switch your body into a fat burning mode rather than a sugar burning one. Restrict eating to an eight hour window each day e.g. eating only between the hours of 11am until 7pm. It will take a few weeks for your body to adjust to this fat burning mode.\r\n<h3>Exercising</h3>\r\nMoving more will get circulation and lymph flowing better and will deliver oxygen and nutrients to tissues and organs as well as promoting increased muscle strength.\r\n<h3>Foods to avoid</h3>\r\nAvoid foods high in sugars especially fructose, carbohydrates and salt as these contribute to cellulite formation. Carbs are the primary source of a substance called glycerol-3-phosphate (g-3-p), which actually causes fat to become fixed in fat tissue. High carbohydrate intake also raises your insulin levels, preventing fat from being released, so sugars and grains are really at the root of stubborn fat deposits. In short avoid processed foods, as they are loaded with fructose and highly processed fats and salt. Instead, focus your diet on whole, ideally organic and locally grown foods, healthful fats such as butter, eggs, avocado, coconut oil, olive oil and nuts, and grass-fed or pastured animal protein. If you need salt, ensure it is natural such as Himalayan salt, which contains about 86 different essential minerals.\r\n\r\nEating this way will support your transition from being a sugar to a fat burner, which is the key to lasting weight loss and optimal health. However, do not attempt fasting if your diet still consists mainly of processed foods. For processed ask yourself “has this been made in a factory?” If the answer is yes, it probably contains too much fructose, carbs and bad fats.\r\n<h2>A note on Cellulite</h2>\r\nCellulite is a particular form of poor tissue tone in which fat stores take on the appearance of \"orange-peel skin\". Localised usually in the thighs, bottom, abdomen and arms, its development is connected to female hormonal activity and the state of blood and lymphatic circulation in the dermis and hypodermis (the deeper layers of the skin) and results from a combination of factors:\r\n<ul>\r\n 	<li>an excessive stagnation of fluid in the tissues</li>\r\n 	<li>poor lymphatic circulation</li>\r\n 	<li>the anomalous development of hypodermic fat cells</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nCellulite\'s formation indicates a change in the structure of the skin, which can take some time to correct. For stubborn areas we recommend treatment with VitalTONE for 6-9 weeks, while supporting the process with healthy eating and exercise. Organic plant extracts of Rosemary, Watercress, Mint, Juniper, Hyssop and Chicory improve the micro-circulation and reduce the accumulation of lipids and toxins in the fat cells via the metabolic stimulatory properties of the formula.

founded by Janice Wilson whose training in Pharmacy and Medicine was followed by a successful career in the pharmaceutical industry. &nbsp;Her growing disillusionment with an industry increasingly intent on over-medicating people and encouraging doctors to do the same, led her to start her&nbsp;own company dedicated to addressing health issues naturally and safely. Combining her medical, pharmaceutical and quality expertise she creates natural products that are solving difficult problems while vastly improving quality of life.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Janice was interviewed by Judith David from&nbsp;<strong>Working Woman&nbsp;</strong>for the following article:</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading -->\n<h2>\"Lifestyle change was simply vital</h2>\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":290,\"align\":\"right\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright\"><img src=\"http://simplyvital.test/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/janice.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-290\"/><figcaption>Janice Wilson</figcaption></figure></div>\n<!-- /wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>The pharmaceutical industry employs many talented people, however, every year a few are motivated to leave and follow a different path…</strong></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That is exactly what Janice Wilson did by starting her company Simply Vital, which offers consumers an alternative way of thinking when it comes to medicine and healing.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After training in medicine and pharmacy at university, Janice built up an impressive CV, working for several pharmaceutical giants, and then a notable list of private consultancy clients. As a busy executive working 70-hour weeks, inevitably she became over-stressed and a bout of depression followed. She was offered the standard cure, a prescription for anti-depressants. However, she stopped short of taking them and decided instead to seek help from a personal development therapist. Over time and much soul searching she discovered there were aspects of “her” that were being denied, not actively but subconsciously.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As Janice’s self-awareness grew, her depression started to lift without the need for drugs and she began to feel better than she ever had done in her life. She also questioned that if she, as a high achiever, had been completely unaware of these hidden parts of herself, then how many of her high achieving colleagues, many of whom were also suffering stress related illnesses, were also “living in the dark” as it were?</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>“I guess I had my mid-life crisis early” says Janice. “Many people consider a new direction mid-career, but usually they are quite fearful of giving up their comfortable lifestyles and routines for the unknown. However, my frustration grew to the point where I felt I really had to follow my instincts and do what I could to offer people an alternative way to find better health.”</em></p></blockquote>\n<!-- /wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With her enquiring mind Janice began researching not only mental illnesses but physical ones too, exploring the emotional causes of both and investigating the power of alternative therapies. She discovered ways to help people with depression in a much more gentle and effective way than the standard prescription of a SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor). Janice believes these drugs effectively prevent a person from feeling any of their feelings, not just the painful, uncomfortable ones that make people seek help in the first place.</p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The whole experience and the results of her research opened up an entirely new area of medicine for Janice.
